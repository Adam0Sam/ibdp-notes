Reports have a section for recommendations

Unlike reviews, reports can reference an object or event that was first introduced/experienced long ago, unlike reviews which rely on a fresh perspective from the author. Most of a report is written in the past tense

Language is full of formal and field specific terms. But a report is always a professional text, as the readers of it are figures of authority who usually themselves formulate the task of writing a report
