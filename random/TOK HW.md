In history and the human sciences, the directive “do not ignore contradictory evidence” holds significant ethical weight. Contradictions offer a pathway to a more nuanced understanding, challenging overly simplistic narratives. 

Consider Elinor Ostrom’s challenge to Hardin’s "Tragedy of the Commons." Hardin predicted communal resources would inevitably collapse without privatization or government control. Yet, Ostrom's research on diverse communities—from Switzerland to the Philippines—showed that resource-sharing systems could thrive through collaboration. Ostrom’s work illustrates that historical and social theories can benefit from acknowledging contradictory evidence, as it fosters more inclusive and dynamic explanations. Contradictions are not barriers to knowledge; they are integral to deeper understanding.

Another example is the analysis of Mongol influence on Russia. A commonly held belief is that Mongol rule imposed authoritarianism, isolating Russia from European development. However, modern scholars, refute this by highlighting Mongol decentralization and active trade with Europe. Moreover, while some historians emphasize the despotic tendencies of Moscow, others highlight Novgorod’s political structure to challenge this view. If historians ignored these contradictions, they would risk reinforcing overly deterministic or nationalistic narratives, failing to capture the complexity of Russia’s political evolution.

In both history and human sciences, engaging with contradictory evidence prevents oversimplification. Ignoring such evidence not only distorts understanding but perpetuates incomplete or biased narratives. Ethically, professionals in these fields are obliged to challenge their assumptions, continually refining their understanding to present a balanced view of complex realities.
