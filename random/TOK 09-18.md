Russia's revolutionary foundation relied upon the ideals of an eternal struggle between the working class and the bourgeois. This was evident in many propaganda campaigns used throughout the SSRS' existence to promote hard, selfless work. Despite this ideological reliance on marxist ideals, Russia as a state did not, in essence, push forward any policy which would've made the proclamation of victory from the working class a reality. In effect, the bourgeois capitalists were replaced by a series bureaucrats which practiced kleptocracy in a very similar fashion to the "long gone" times of the Tsar and his subordinates. A betrayal of founding ideals can be, in part, cause of the eventual degradation that caused the collapse of the SSRS.
