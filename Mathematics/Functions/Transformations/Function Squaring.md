For ${y=[f(x)]^2 \ }$, the following applies
- The graph of ${y=[f(x)]^2 \ }$ touches the $x$-axis at its $x$-intercepts
- ${[f(x)]^2 \ \ge 0}$
- The vertical asymptotes of $f$ are the vertical asymptotes of $f^2$
- When ${-1<f(x)<1 \ }$, ${y=[f(x)]^2 \ }$ is closer to the $x$-axis than $y=f(x)$ (The opposite is true when $|f(x)| >1$)
