A **periodic function** is one which repeats itself over and over in a horizontal direction, in intervals of the same length. The **period** of a periodic function is the length of one repetition or cycle

$$
\begin{array}{}
f(x) \text{ is a periodic function with period } p \ \text{ if } \\ f(x + p) = f(x), \quad \text{for all } x \end{array}$$
