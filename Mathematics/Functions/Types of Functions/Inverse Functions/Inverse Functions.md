If the function $f(x)$ is [[One-to-One Functions|one-to-one]], it will have an inverse function which we denote $f^{-1}(x)$

If a functions $f(x)$ is [[Many-to-One Functions|many-to-one]], it does **not** have an inverse

If a function $f(x)$ is symmetrical about the line $y=x$, it is a [[Self-Inverse Functions|self-inverse function]] 

An inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$:
- Must satisfy the *vertical line test*
- Has a graph which is the reflection of $y=f(x)$ in the line $y=x$
- Satisfies $(f^{-1}\circ f)(x)=x$ and $( f \circ f^{-1})(x)=x$

> [!Tip] The identity function
> $$y = x$$
> .. because it is its own inverse, and when its inverse is found, $(x,y)$ maps onto itself

### Geometrically
Inverse functions are derived by reflecting the graph of $y=f(x)$ in the line $y=x$
