These are [[Rational Functions]] in the form 
$$y=\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}, \ c\ne0$$

> For a function written in the form $y=\frac{b}{cx+d}+a,\quad b,c\ne0$
> 
> - The vertical asymptote is $x=-\frac{d}{c}$
> - The horizontal asymptote is $y=a$

>  For a function written in the form $y=\frac{ax+b}{cx+d},\quad c\ne0$
>  
> - The vertical asymptote is $x=-\frac{d}{c}$
> - The horizontal asymptote is $y=\frac{a}{c}$
