For a function in the form $$y=\frac{ax^2+bx+c}{dx+e}, \quad d\ne0$$
, we use [[Polynomial Division]] to write them in the form $$y=px+q+\frac{r}{dx+e}$$`

- The function is undefined when $dx+e=0$, so the graph has the vertical asymptote $x=-\frac{e}{d}$
 
- As $|x|\rightarrow \infty$ , the term $\frac{r}{dx+e}\rightarrow0$, so the graph has the **oblique asymptote** $y=px+p$
