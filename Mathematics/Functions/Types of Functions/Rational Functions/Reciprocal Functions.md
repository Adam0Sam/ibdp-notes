A function in the from $y=\frac{k}{x}, \ k\ne 0$

The graph of a reciprocal function is a **rectangular hyperbola**

> [!Tip] The graph includes two asymptotes $x=0$ and $y=0$
> 
> As ${x \rightarrow 0^-, \ \frac{1}{x} \rightarrow -\infty}$
> As ${x \rightarrow 0^+, \ \frac{1}{x} \rightarrow -\infty}$
> 
> As ${x \rightarrow \infty, \ \frac{1}{x} \rightarrow 0^+}$
> As ${x \rightarrow -\infty, \ \frac{1}{x} \rightarrow 0^-}$


As one would expected, the reciprocal function always passes through the points ${(1, k), \ (k, 1), \ (-1, -k), \ (-k, -1)}$


> [!Tip] The reciprocal of a function $y=f(x)$ is the function $y=\frac{1}{f(x)}$
> - The zeros and asymptotes of $y=f(x)$ respectively become the asymptotes and zeros of the reciprocal
> - The *local maxima* and *local minima* switch places in the same manner
