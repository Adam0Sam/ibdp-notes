A **polynomial** is a function which can be written in the form
$$
P(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ ... \ + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0 = \sum_{r=0}^na_rx^r
$$
- $x$ is the **variable**
- $a_0$ is the **constant term**
- $a_n$ is the **leading coefficient**
- $a_r$ is the **coefficient of $x^r$** for $r = 0, 1, 2, \ ..., \ n$
- $n$ is the **degree** of the polynomial, being the highest power of the variable- $a_rx^r$ is the term of the polynomial with degree $r$

All mathematical operations apply to polynomials however multiplication is more easily done via [[Synthetic polynomial multiplication]]

A similar logic applies with [[Polynomial division]]

The [[Polynomial Roots|roots of a polynomial]] $P(x)$ are the solutions to the equation $P(x)=0$
According to the fundamental theorem of Algebra there exist $n$ roots for every $\text{nth}$   degree polynomial

Each polynomial can be written in both the [[Linear Factors of Polynomials|factorised and the expanded form]]

>[!Example] $$\text{For any polynomial} \ f(x), \ \text{the sum of its coefficients is} \ f(1)$$
>$f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x -7$
>*sum of coefficients: * $f(1) = 1^3 + 2\cdot1^2 + 3\cdot1-7=-1$
