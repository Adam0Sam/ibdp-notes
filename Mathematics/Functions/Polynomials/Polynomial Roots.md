A **zero**, $\alpha$, of a polynomial is a value of the variable which makes the polynomial equal to *zero*
$$P(x) \Leftrightarrow P(\alpha) = 0$$

The **roots** of a polynomial equation are the solutions to the equation
$$\alpha \ \text{is a root of } \ P(x)=0 \Leftrightarrow P(\alpha)=0$$

> The roots of $P(x)=0$ are the zeros of $P(x)$ and the x-intercepts of the graph $y=P(x)$
