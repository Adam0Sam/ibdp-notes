If $P(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$, then $P(x)$ has exactly $n$ zeros, each of which may be written in the [[Complex Numbers|complex form]] $a+bi$, where $a, b\in\mathbb{R}$, and some of which may be reapeated

> [!Tip] Properties established
> - Every **real** polynomial of degree $n$ can be factorised into complex linear factors
> - Every polynomial can be expressed as a product of **real** linear and **real** irreducible quadratic factors (*where $\Delta<0$*)
> - If $p+qi \ (q\ne 0)$ is a zero of a **real** polynomial then its [[Conjugates of Complex Numbers|complex conjugate]] $p-qi$ is also a zero
> - Every **real** polynomial of odd degree has at least one real zero
