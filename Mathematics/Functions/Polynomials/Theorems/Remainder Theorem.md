If a polynomial $P(x)$ is divided by a linear polynomial $x-k$ until a constant remainder $R$ is obtained, then $R=P(k)$

#### Proof

By the [[Mathematics/Functions/Polynomials/Polynomial Division|division algorithm]], 
$$
\begin{array}{}
P(x) = Q(x)(x-k)+R \\
\text{Let } x=k, \quad P(k) = Q(k)\cdot0+R=R
\end{array}
$$
