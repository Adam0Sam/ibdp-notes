Suppose a [[Continuous Random Variables|continuous random variable]] $X$ is normally distributed with a a mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. 

For each value of $x$ a $z$-score my be calculated using the algebraic transformation (also called the $Z$-transformation)

$$
z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
$$

From [[The Standard Normal Distribution]], it may be said that the $z$-score can be understood as the number of standard deviations $x$ is from the mean ($|x-\mu|$)
