The **probability density function** of a [[Continuous Random Variables|continuous random variable]] is the derivative of the variable's cumulative distribution function $F(x)=\mathrm{P}(X\leq x)$

For a continuous random variable $X$ on the domain $a\leq x\leq b$, the probability density functions is a function $f(x)$ such that
$$
\begin{align}
&\mathrm{P}(c \le X \le d) = \int_{c}^{d} f(x) \, dx  \\
&f(x)\ge 0 \quad \forall~ a\leq x \leq b \\
&\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx =1
\end{align}
$$


> [!tip] Properties
The measures of mode, median, mean/expectation, variance and standard deviation are simply continuous analogues of their [[Discrete Random Variables|discrete]] counterparts
> 
> Thus linear transformations of a continuous random variable $X$ result in identical mutations to expectation, variance and deviation [[Linear Transformation of a Random Variable|as with discrete random variables]]
