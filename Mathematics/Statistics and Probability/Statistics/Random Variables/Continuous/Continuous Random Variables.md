For a continuous [[Random Variables|random variable]] $X$, $x \in \mathbb{R}$. Because $\mathbb{R}$ has an infinite set of possible $x$ values, the following holds true for all $x$
$$
P(X=x)=0
$$


> [!tip] [[Probability Density Functions]]
Since the probability of a continuous $X$ always takes a value of $0$, we cannot use a [[Probability Mass Functions|probability mass function]] to describe its distribution. Instead, a [[Probability Density Functions|probabiltiy density function]] is used

> [!Tip] The [[Normal Probability Density Function]]
> Functions whose global maxima exist in a centered point, from which the functions values exponentially decrease
