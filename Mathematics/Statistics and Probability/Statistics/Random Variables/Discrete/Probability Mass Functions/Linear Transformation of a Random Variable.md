A related random variable of $X$ is denoted as $aX+b$ where $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$ This relation be considered as a **linear transformation**.

It thus follows that the properties of [[Expectation]] and [[Variance and Standard Deviation|standard deviation]] are also linearly transformed as such

$$
\begin{array}{t}
 E(aX+b) = aE(x)+b \\
 \mathrm{Var}(aX+b) = a^{2}\mathrm{Var}(X) \\
\sigma(aX+b)=|a|\sigma(X) 
\end{array}
$$
