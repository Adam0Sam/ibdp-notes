A random variable uses numbers to describe the possible outcomes which could result from a random experiment.

> A [[Discrete Random Variables|discrete random variable]] $X$ has a set of distinct possible values.

> A [[Continuous Random Variables|continuous random variable]] X can take any value within some interval on the number line.

For any random variable, there is a corresponding **[[Probability Distribution|probability distribution]]** which describes the probability that that variable will take a particular value (the probability that $\mathrm{P}(X=x)$, where $x$ is some value)
