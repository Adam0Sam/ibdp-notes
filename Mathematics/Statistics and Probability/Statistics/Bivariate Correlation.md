There are several characteristics which describe bivariate correlations: [[#direction]], [[#linearity]], [[#strength]], [[#outliers]] and [[#causality]]

Both the direction and strength of a correlation may be determined using [[Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient]]

To find the exact linear equation which models a correlation in the most basic manner, the least squares [[Linear Regression|regression line]] is used.

### Causality

If a change in one variable causes a change in the other variable then we say that a causal relationship exists between them.
