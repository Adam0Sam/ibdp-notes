Bivariate data is, as the name implies, data with two recorded numerical variables (dependent and independent). The study of such data yields knowledge about the relationship/[[Bivariate Correlation|correlation]] between the two variables. 

We can often determine the *possible values* a variable can take and assign each possible value a probability (e.g. [[Random Variables|random variables]])

In mathematics, the chance of an event occurring is assigned a number between 0 and 1 inclusive. We call this number a probability, the likelihood of an event or outcome from [[The Sample Space|the sample space]]
