The **event** that both $A$ *and* $B$ occur is written $A \cap B$

The **event** that either $A$ *or* $B$ *or both*   occur is written $A\cup B$

> [!info] The Addition Law of Probability
For the two events $A$ and $B$:
>$$
\mathrm{P}(A \cup B) = \mathrm{P}(A)+\mathrm{P}(B)-\mathrm{P}(A \cap B) 
$$


> [!tip] Mutually Exclusive Events
> If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint *mutually exclusive* events then $\mathrm{P}(A \cap B)=0 \Rightarrow  \mathrm{P}(A \cup B) = \mathrm{P}(A) + \mathrm{P}(B)$
