In cases where we are given some information (the hypothesis) and are asked to prove something, we use a chain of implications.
This is called **proof by deduction**.

Proof by deduction is called a *direct proof* because we start with the hypothesis and work forward towards the **conclusion**.

In these types of proof to show that two statements $A$ and $B$ are equivalent, we need to prove both ${A \Rightarrow B \ }$ and ${ \ B \Rightarrow A}$
