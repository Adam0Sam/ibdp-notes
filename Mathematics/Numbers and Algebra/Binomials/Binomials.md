The sum $a+b$ is called a *binomial* as it contains two terms
Any expression of the form $(a+b)^n$ is called a power of a binomial

> [!Tip] For the **binomial expansion** of $(a+b)^n$, where $n \in \mathbb{N}$
> - As we look from left to right across the expansion the powers of $a$ decrease by 1, while the powers of $b$ increase by 1
> - The sum of the powers of $a$ and $b$ in each term of the expansion is $n$
> <br>
> - The number of terms in the expansion is $n+1$
> - The coefficients of the terms are row $n$ of [[Pascal's triangle]]


The [[Binomial Theorem]] simplifies the tedious work of manually expanding $nth$ power binomials
