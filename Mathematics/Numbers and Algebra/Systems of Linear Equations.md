An $m \cdot n$ system of linear equations is
- **Inconsistent** if it has no solution
- **Consistent** if it has at least one solution
In the same manner, an $m \cdot n$ system of linear equations is
- **Underspecified** if it has more unknowns than equations
- **Overspecified** if has more equations than unknowns

It is incredibly useful to express such systems using [[Augmented Matrices]]
