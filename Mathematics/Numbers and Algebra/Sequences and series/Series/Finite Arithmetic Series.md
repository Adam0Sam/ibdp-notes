The sum of a finite arithmetic series with the first term $u_1$, common difference $d$ and last term $u_n$ is
$$S_n = \frac{n}{2}(u_1+u_n)$$
or
$$S_n = \frac{n}{2}(2u_1 + (n-1)d)$$
---
#### Proof
$$
\begin{array}{l}
S_n = u_1 + (u_1 + d) + \ ... \ + (u_n - d ) + u_n \\
+ \\
S_n = u_n + (u_n - d ) + \ ... \ + (u_1 + d) + u_1 \\ 
\\
2S_n = (u_1 + u_n) + \ ... \ + (u_1 + u_n) \qquad \text{(n times)}
\end{array}
$$
