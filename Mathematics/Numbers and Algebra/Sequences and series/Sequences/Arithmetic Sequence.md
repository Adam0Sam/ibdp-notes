Sequences in which each terms deviates from the term before it by an arithmetic constant

> **The Explicit formula**
> $u_n = u_1 + d(n-1)$, where $u_1$ is the first term and $d$ the deviation constant

> **The Recursive formula**
> $u_n = u_{n-1}+d$

<br>

> [!Example] Finite example
> $\{a_k\}_{k=1}^4 = \{1, 4, 7, 10\}$
> or making it *an explicit function*
> $\{a_k\}_{k=1}^4 \text{with} \ a_k = 1+3(k-1)$

> [!Example] Infinite *explicit function*
> $\{a_k\}_{k=1}^\infty \text{with} \ a_k = 1+4(k-1)$

> [!Tip] Sequences are functions!
> Thus, both $a_k$ and $a(k)$ are correct ways of notation
