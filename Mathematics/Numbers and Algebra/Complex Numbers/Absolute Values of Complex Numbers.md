The [[Absolute Values, Modulus|distance]] between the point of the complex number on the [[Argand Diagram]] and the origin

As demonstrated [here](https://youtu.be/yvzyC4VBpUU) one can simply use the Pythagorean theorem in the *complex plane* to find the distance between $0$ and $a + bi$

$${|a+bi| = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}}$$

### Properties

$$
\begin{array}{l}
1. \ |\overline{z}| = |z|
\\ \\2. \ |z|^2 = z\cdot \overline{z}
\\ \\ 3. \ |z_1z_2| = |z_1|\cdot |z_2|
\\ \\ 4. \ |\frac{z_1}{z_2}| = \frac{|z_1|}{|z_2|} \quad \text{provided} \ z_2 \ne 0
\\ \\ 5. \ |z^n| = |z|^n,\quad \text{for} \ n \in \mathbb{Z}^+
\end{array}
$$

> [!Tip] When solving equations with absolute complex expressions 
> like, for example, $3|z+1|=|z+9|$. **Be sure to raise both sides of the equation by order of two,** *as then you can express the modulus as the product of* $z \cdot \overline{z}$
