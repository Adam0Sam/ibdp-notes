> ### Cartesian form
$z=a + bi$ where $a \in \mathbb{R}$ 
*E.g:* $5+3i$

### Polar form 
A complex number can also be expressed through it's vector's [[Absolute Values of Complex Numbers|modulus]] $r$ and the argument $\phi$ (the angle between the abscissa and the vector). 

> The modulus
> $$r = | z | = \sqrt{a^2+b^2}$$

> The argument
> $$\theta = \arg z  = \arctan \frac{b}{a}$$
> It must be noted that $\arg z$ is a convention, *thus* $-\pi<\arg z\le \pi$
  
Given both variables, you can express $z$ as 
$$
z = r\cos\phi+ r \sin\phi i \\
= r(\cos\phi+  \sin\phi i) \\
$$
> [!Info] $cis\theta$
> **We define [[cis]] as** $cis\theta = cos\theta + isin\theta$
> *thus* $$z = |z|\cdot cis\theta$$

> ### Exponential form
> Euler derived this from the polar expression
> $$e^{\theta i} = \cos\theta+  \sin\theta i, \quad \text{for any }\theta \in \mathbb{R}$$
> *Be sure to convert $\phi$ from degrees to radians?*
