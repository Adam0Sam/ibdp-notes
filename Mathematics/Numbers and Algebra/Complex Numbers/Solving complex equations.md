The complex solutions to equations such as $x^3=1$ ar equal in amount to the order the unknown variable was raised to 
$$
\begin{array}
\ x^3 = 1 = e^{2\pi i} = e^{4\pi i} \\
\text{1. }(x^3)^{\frac{1}{3}} = 1^{\frac{1}{3}} \rightarrow x=1+0i \\
\text{2. }(x^3)^{\frac{1}{3}} = (e^{2\pi i})^{\frac{1}{3}} \rightarrow x=e^{\frac{2\pi}{3} i} \\
\text{3. }(x^3)^{\frac{1}{3}} = (e^{4\pi i})^{\frac{1}{3}} \rightarrow x=e^{\frac{4\pi}{3} i} \\
\text{if we were to continue expanding the orders} \\ 
\text{we would end up simply rotating along already existing solutions} \\
(x^3)^{\frac{1}{3}} = (e^{6\pi i})^{\frac{1}{3}} \rightarrow x=e^{\frac{6\pi}{3} i} = e^{2\pi i} = 1
\end{array}
$$
*not exactly what I did here but usually you find complex roots [[Roots of Complex Numbers|this way]]*

Complex numbers enable us to solve quadratic equations of $D<0$
$$
\begin{array}
2x^2-6x+5=0 \\
\ x_{1,2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36-4 \cdot 2 \cdot 5}}{4}=\frac{6 \pm \sqrt{-4}}{4} = \frac{6 \pm i \sqrt4}{4} = 1.5 \pm i
\end{array}$$
