A permutation is *any arrangement* of a group of symbols in a *definite order* $${P_n = n!}$$
The number of permutations of $n$ different symbols taken at $r$ at a time is
 $${A_n^r = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}}$$



> [!tip] Permutations where some symbols are repeated
> Suppose there are $n_{1}$ of the first symbol, $n_{2}$ of the second symbol, ..., and $n_{r}$ of the $r$th symbol
> 
> The total number of distinguishable permutations is $$\frac{(n_{1}+n_{2}+\dots n_{r})!}{n_{1}!n_{2}!\dots n_{r}!}$$
