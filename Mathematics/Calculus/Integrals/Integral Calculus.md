The process of finding $y$ from $\frac{dy}{dx}$, of $f(x)$ from $f'(x)$ s the reverse process of [[Differential Calculus|differentiation]], or *antidifferentiation*

[[The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]] explains how we can find the value of [[definite integrals]]

The process of finding an [[Indefinite Integrals|indefinite integral]] is called *indefinite integration*

Integrals may also be [[Improper Integrals|improper]]

> [!tip] Through integration, we can find the area between a curve and another curve or an axis 
> ### Area between a curve and the X-axis
>$$
>A = \int_{a}^{b} |f(x)| \, dx 
>$$
>
> ### Area between two curves
>$$
>A = \int_{a}^{b} (f(x)-g(x)) \, dx 
>$$
>
> ###  Area between a curve and the Y-axis
>$$
>A = \int_{a}^{b} |f^{-1}(y)| \, dy 
>$$

Taking any function $f(x)$ and revolving it around an axis gives a [[Solids of  Revolution|solid of revolution]]
