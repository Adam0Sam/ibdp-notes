$$
\text{If } F'(x)=f(x) \quad \text{ then } \quad \int f(x) \, dx =F(x)+c
$$
where the constant $c$ is called the constant of integration (given any value of $F(x)$, $c$ can be found)

Similar properties as in [[Definite Integrals]] also apply to indefinite integrals (of course, the proofs are different)

1. $$
\int kf(x) \, dx =k\int f(x) \, dx, \quad \text{where } k \text{ is a constant}
$$
2. $$
\int (f(x)+g(x)) \, dx =\int f(x) \, dx +\int g(x) \, dx 
$$
[[Common Integrals]] exist to make some common integrals easy to solve
