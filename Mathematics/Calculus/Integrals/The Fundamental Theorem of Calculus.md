$$
\text{For a continuous function } f(x) \text{ with an antiderivative } F(x),
$$
$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = [F(x)]^b_{a} = F(b)-F(a) 
$$
where $\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx$ is a [[Definite Integrals|definite integral]] and $f(x)\ge 0$ (as $f(x)$ is the derivative of $F(x)$, $f(x)\ge 0 \implies F(x) \text{ is increasing}$ )
