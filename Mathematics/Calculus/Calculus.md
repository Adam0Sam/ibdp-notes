This is the branch of mathematics that deals with the finding and properties of [[Differential Calculus|derivatives]] and [[Integral Calculus|integrals]] of [[functions]]

Note that not only series can be differentiated and integrated but also series, like the [[The Maclaurin Series|Maclaurin]]

Equations involving [[Differential Calculus|derivatives]] are called [[Differential Equations]]
