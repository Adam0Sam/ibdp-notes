These *rules* are essentially just abstractions derived from the [[Differential Calculus|limit definition of a derivative]] 

The theoretical foundation lies in the [[Simple Rules of Differentiation]]

[[The Chain Rule]] is even greater abstractions derived from the *simple rules* mentioned above

The *Chain Rule* gives rise to [[The Product Rule]] 

Further abstracting, the *Product Rule* is the basis of [[The Quotient Rule]] 

Besides the "foundational" rules, there are observations into the nature of the derivatives of [[Derivatives of Functions|various functions]]
