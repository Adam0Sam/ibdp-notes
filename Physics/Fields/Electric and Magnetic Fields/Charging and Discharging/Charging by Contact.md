When objects come in contact with each other, excess electrons, or a deficit of electrons may be shared between them.

> [!Tip] Grounding
> By making a good conducting path (of low resistance) with the ground, we *ground* an object and prevent it from being [[Electric Charge|positively/negatively charged]]. The object is kept at $0\mathrm{V}$
