An electric field is a region in which a [[Electric Charge|charge]] would experience an [[Coulomb's Law|electric force]]

> [!Tip] Convection
> Electric fields are represented with electric field lines. The direction of these lines always points in the direction of the forces on positive charges

Field lines can never cross each other ( #todo why) and the field is strongest (in a diagram) where the field lines are closest together (densest)

> Observe that electric field lines must be perpendicular to any conducting surface. (*If this was not true, there would be a component of the electric force acting on the electrons, so that they would rearrange until the field was perpendicular.*)

> [!Example] Charge Distribution
> If a surface is flat, the forces between adjacent mobile charges will be parallel to the surface and this results in an even distribution of charges. However, if a surface is curved, $\text{charge concentration} \propto \text{curvature}$

[[Electric Field Strength]], $E$, is defined as the force per unit charge that would be experienced by a small positive test charge place at that point
