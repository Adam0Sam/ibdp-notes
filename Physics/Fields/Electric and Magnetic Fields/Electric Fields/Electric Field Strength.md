Electric field strength, $E$, is defined as the force per unit charge that would be experienced by a small positive test charge place at that point
$$
E=\frac{F}{q}
$$
To calculate electric field strength between parallel plates consider $W=Fd=Vq$ , where $V$ is the potential difference and $d$ - distance
$$
\therefore E=\frac{Fd}{qd}=\frac{Vq}{qd}=\frac{V}{d}
$$
> [!Tip] electron volts
> Electric field strength can be expressed with electron volts. $1\mathrm{eV}$ is the work done when an [[elementary charge]] is accelerated by a potential difference of $1\mathrm{V}$ 


The strength of an electric field around a point charge decreases with the square of the distance (an [[inverse square law]] relationship)
$$
E=\frac{kq}{r^2}
$$
where $k$ is [[Coulomb's Law|Coulomb's constant]]
