The magnetic permeability of a  medium, or free space, represents its ability to transfer a [[Magnetic Fields|magnetic field]] and force. (and it broadly corresponds to [[Permittivity|electric permittivity]]) 

$$
\text{Permeability of free space}, \ \mu_{0} = 4\pi \cdot 10^{-7}\ \mathrm{TmA}^{-1}
$$
