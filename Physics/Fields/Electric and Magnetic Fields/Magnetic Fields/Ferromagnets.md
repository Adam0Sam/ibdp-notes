Some rare earth materials, which have the potential to be magnetized, are known as **ferromagnetic** materials. 

*Soft* ferromagnetic materials (like pure iron) loose their magnetism quickly, while *hard* ones (like steel) retain it longer

> [!tip] Induced Magnetism
When ferromagnetic materials are located in [[magnetic fields]], they tend to become magnetized to some extent

> [!Info] The earth
> The earth itself behaves as very large, weak bar magnet

> The magnetic north pole of a magnet is so called because that end of a freely suspended magnet points towards geographic North (where there is a south magnetic pole).
