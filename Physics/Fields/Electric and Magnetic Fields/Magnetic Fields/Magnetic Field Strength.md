The magnitude of the magnetic force, $F$, is proportional to the magnitude of the current, $I$, the length of the conductor in the field, $L$, and the magnetic field strength, $B$

$$
F = BIL \implies B = \frac{F}{IL} \ \ (\mathrm{NA}^{-1}\mathrm{m}^{-1})
$$

$\mathrm{NA}^{-1}\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ is also known as 1 tesla ($\mathrm{T}$)

The magnetic field strength at a distance $r$ from a current $I$ in a long straight wire in air is 
$$
B = \frac{\mu_{0}I}{2\pi r}
$$
, where $\mu_{0}$, [[Magnetic Permeability|the constant of permeability in free space]] approximates the permeability in air
