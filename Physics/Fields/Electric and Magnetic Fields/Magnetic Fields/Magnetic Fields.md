A magnetic fields exists anywhere that a magnetic force occurs. 

> [!tip] How magnetic fields form
Magnetic fields are produced around all [[Motion in Magnetic Fields|moving]] [[Electric Charge|charges]] (currents). Any stationary charge has an [[Electric Fields|electric field]] but if a charge moves, there is also a magnetic field around it, which is perpendicular to the electric field.

> Magnetic field lines always form closed loops. The direction of field liens (around a [[Ferromagnets|magnet]]) is from a magnetic north pole to a magnetic south pole

Similarly as with [[electric fields]], the concepts of [[Magnetic Permeability|permeability]] and field [[Magnetic Field Strength|strength]] apply to magnetic fields
