The forces between point charges can be represented by an [[inverse square law]]

Coulomb's Law is rather similar to the [[Universal Law of Gravitation]] 
$$
F=k \frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^2}
$$
where $k$ is the Coulomb constant of value $8.99\cdot 10^9\ \mathrm{Nm}^2\mathrm{C}^{-2}$

> [!Example] $k$ is not a universal constant...
> because it can be further simplified, unlike [[Universal Law of Gravitation|G]]
> 
>$$
k=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}}
>$$
>
> The $\frac{1}{4\pi}$ represents the radial nature of the force and $\epsilon_{0}$ is the fundamental constant of [[Permittivity|electrical permittivity of free space]]

> [!Tip] $\pm$
> Negative force between to charged objects symbolizes attraction, while positive force identifies repulsion
