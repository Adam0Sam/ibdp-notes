Electric charge is a fundamental property of some subatomic particles, responsible for the forces between them. It is measured in *coulombs*, $\mathrm{C}$

> [!Tip] Microcoulombs
One coulomb is a relatively large amount of charge and more often microcoulombs $(1\micro \mathrm{C}= 10^{-6}\mathrm{C})$ are used

All protons and electrons have the same magnitude of [[Elementary Charge]], $\pm 1.60\cdot {10}^{-19}\mathrm{C}$
