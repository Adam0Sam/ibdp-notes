A particle with a charge $q$ in an electric field will experience a force $F = Eq$ towards the oppositely charged plate. 

> [!tip] Constructing Uniform Fields
The easiest way of producing a uniform electric field is by connecting a potential difference across parallel metal plates

Stationary *mobile* charges will accelerate along a field line in a uniform electric field

Freely charged particles moving across electric fields will move in parabolic paths (due to the fact that velocity is one direction, and acceleration is in another)
