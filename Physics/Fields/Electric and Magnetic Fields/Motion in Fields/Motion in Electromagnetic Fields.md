To understand charged particle motion in electromagnetic fields, one must first understand the [[Motion in Electric Fields|charged motion in electric]] and [[Motion in Magnetic Fields|charged motion in magnetic]] fields

Any charged particle moving across both an [[Electric Fields|electric field]] and a [[Magnetic Fields|magnetic field]] will experience two forces (one parallel to the electric field and one perpendicular to the magnetic field)

> [!example] When electric and magnetic field forces cancel out
> If the motion of a [[Electric Charge|charged particle]] is unaffected by perpendicular electric and magnetic fields, then

\begin{array}{t}
\text{magnetic force} = \text{electric force} \implies \\
