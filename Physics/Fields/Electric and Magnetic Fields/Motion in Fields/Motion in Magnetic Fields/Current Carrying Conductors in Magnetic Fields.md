Electrons [[Motion in Magnetic Fields|moving cross a magnetic field]] in a current-carrying conductor will experience the same forces as if they were in an electron beam traveling across a vacuum

The current through a wire, $I$, is $\frac{q}{t}$, while all the electrons have an average (drift) speed of $v$ through the wire so that in a time $t$ they travel an average distance $L=vt$
 
$$
F=qvB\sin \theta = \left( \frac{q}{t} \right)vtB\sin\theta = ILB\sin\theta
$$

Consider the [[Magnetic Fields#Right hand grip rule|right hand grip rule]] and the figure above. Above the wire, the magnetic field between the [[Ferromagnets|permanent magnets]] and the magnetic field of the current act in opposite directions and thus combine to a weaker magnetic field. Below the wire they act in the same direction and produce a stronger field.
 
This difference in magnetic field strength on either side of the wire produces an upward force on the wire, which can make the wire move (if its not fixed)
