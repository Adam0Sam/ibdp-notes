A stationary charge in a [[Magnetic Fields|magnetic field]] will not experience any [[Magnetic Field Strength|magnetic force]], while any charge *moving* in a magnetic field will experience a force which is perpendicular to both the directions of its velocity and the magnetic field

The force, $F$, on a charged particle moving across a uniform magnetic field is proportional to its charge - $q$, velocity - $v$, the [[Magnetic Field Strength|strength of the magnetic field]] - $B$ and the angle between the velocity vector and field lines - $\theta$

$$
F = qvB\sin\theta
$$
Of course, if the particle is moving perpendicularly, $\theta=90\degree \implies \sin\theta=1$ and thus
$$
F = qvB
$$
where $F$ now can be considered as the [[Centripetal Force|centripetal force]] causing [[Circular Motion and Centripetal Forces|circular motion]]
$$
F=qvB=\frac{mv^{2}}{r}\implies r=\frac{mv}{qB}
$$
