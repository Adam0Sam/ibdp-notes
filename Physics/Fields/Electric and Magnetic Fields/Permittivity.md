$\epsilon_{0}$ is called the electrical permittivity of free space and has a value of $8.85 \cdot 10^{-12} \ \mathrm{C}^2\mathrm{N}^{-1}\mathrm{m}^{-2}$

$\epsilon_{0}$ represents the ability of free space to transfer an [[Coulomb's Law|electric force]] and [[Electric Fields|field]]

> [!Example] Other Permittivities
> The permittivities of other substances ar all greater than $\epsilon_{0}$ (although dry air has similar electrical properties to free space).
