If a neutral object is given excess electrons, it becomes [[Electric Charge|negatively charged]]. If the number of electrons is reduced, the object becomes [[Electric Charge|positively charged]]. 

There are a number of [[Charging and Discharging|ways to charge an object]]

Continuing the theme of charge, the forces between two point charges obey [[Coulomb's Law]]

Combining everything above, we get the definition of an [[Electric Fields|electric field]], a region in which a [[Electric Charge|charge]] would experience an [[Coulomb's Law|electric force]]

Similarly to electric forces, [[Magnetic Fields]] can act across space

When a [[Electric Charge|charged particle]] exists in an [[Electromagnetic Waves|electromagnetic]] field, it experiences [[Motion in Electromagnetic Fields|motion]]
