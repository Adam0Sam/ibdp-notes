#### Kepler's first law
The planets orbit in elliptical paths, with the Sun at one of the two foci.

#### Kepler's third law
In practice, many orbits are close to being circular, thus we can usually assume that $R$ is the orbital radius

$$
T^2 \propto R^3
$$
where $T$ is a planet's orbital time period
