Orbital motion is, in essence, just [[Uniform Circular Motion|circular motion]] where the [[Centripetal Force]] is provided by [[Universal Law of Gravitation|gravity]]

In order to maintain a satellite in a circular orbit around the Earth, it needs to be given the correct speed, $v$, for its particular radius, $r$

$$
g=\frac{v^2}{r}
$$

> [!Tip] Variation in satellite speed
If the speed of a satellite is greater than the speed necessary for circular orbit, but less than the *escape speed*, it will move in an elliptical path
