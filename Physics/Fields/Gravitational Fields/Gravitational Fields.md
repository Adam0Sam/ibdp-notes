A scientific understanding of gravity requires accurate observations of objects moving large distances where gravitational effects are variable and unaffected by air resistance: the planets and the Moon.

The foundation of this understanding lies in the (empirical) [[Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion]], Newton supplemented this foundation with the [[Universal Law of Gravitation]]
