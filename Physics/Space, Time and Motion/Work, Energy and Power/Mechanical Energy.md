**mechanical [[energy]]** - is the sum of [[#Kinetic Energy]], [[#Gravitational Potential Energy]] and [[#Elastic Potential Energy]]

in a closed system, mechanical energy is conserved
### Kinetic Energy
> ![[Pasted image 20231219160415.png]]
>$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
> this equation can be easily related to [[momentum]]
>$$\frac{m\cdot mv^2}{m\cdot 2} = \frac{p^2}{2m}$$

### Gravitational Potential Energy
> $$\Delta E_p = mg\Delta h$$

<br>

### Elastic Potential Energy
> derived from [[Elastic Restoring force|Hooke's law]]
> $$W = Fs = \frac{1}{2}F_h\cdot \Delta x = \frac{1}{2}(k\Delta x)\Delta x = \frac{1}{2}k\Delta x^2 $$
> $$E_h = W = \frac{1}{2}k\Delta x^2 $$
