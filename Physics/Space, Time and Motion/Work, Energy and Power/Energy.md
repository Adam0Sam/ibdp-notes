> ### Potential Energy
Energy that arises because of forces between different parts of the system
> - **Gravitational** - energy stored due to the position of a mass in a gravitational field
> - **Electric** - energy stored due to the position of a charge in an electric field
> - **Magnetic** - energy stored due to the position in a magnetic field
> - **Elastic** - energy stored in a deformed elastic material, or spring
> - **Chemical** - energy stored in the bonding of chemical compounds, released in chemical reactions
> - **Nuclear** - energy stored in the arrangement of particles in the nuclei of atoms

Of these **[[mechanical energy]]** can come in one of the three forms:
- Kinetic Energy
- Elastic Potential Energy
- Gravitational Potential Energy

**[[Internal energy]]** - the name given to the enormous amount of energy which exists within all matter because of the motions and positions of the particles it contains

> [!Tip] all macroscopic processes dissipate energy into the surroundings

> [!Tip] [[Work]] done by the resultant force on a system is equal to the change in the energy of the system
