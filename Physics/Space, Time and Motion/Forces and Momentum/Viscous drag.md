**Viscosity** - a fluids (*be it either gas or liquid*) resistance to movement

According to Stoke's law, when a smooth and spherical object with a radius $r$ moves through a *liquid* at speed $v$, which is not great enough to cause **Turbulence** (*irregular movements*) in the fluid, *the viscous drag is*
$$F_d = 6\pi \eta rv$$, with $\eta$ (*eta*) being the viscosity of a given fluid 

with $\eta$ and $r$ being constants, $F_d$ is proportional to $v$ ($F_d \propto v$)
