Generally, there are two types of friction: **static** and **dynamic**

Just before motion begins: $$F_f = \mu_s F_n$$, where $\mu_s$ is the coefficient of static friction

<br>
When there is movement, *dynamic frictional force* $$F_f=\mu_dF_n$$, where $\mu_d$ is the coefficient of dynamic friction


p.s.: $F_n$ is the *normal force*, perpendicular to the surface that an object *frictions* against
