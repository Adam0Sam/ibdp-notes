Many forces only act for a short time, $\Delta t$. 

Clearly the longer the *time* for which a force *acts*, the greater its *possible effect*, so the concept of **impulse**, $J$, becomes useful

$$J = F\Delta t$$

Impulse is the change in [[Momentum]]

$$
\begin{array}{l}
F=\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} \\\Delta p = F\cdot \Delta t = J 
\end{array}
$$

An impulse on an *isolated* object results in momentum, which is numerically equal to the impulse
