$$\text{Linear momentum: } \ p=mv$$
Momentum is a vector quantity and its direction is always important.

> [!Info] The Law of Conservation of Momentum
> The total momentum of any system is constant, provided that there is no resultant external force acting on it

$F=ma=\frac{m(v-u)}{t}$ offers a more generalized interpretation of [[Newton's Laws of Motion|Newton's second law]] in terms of a *change of momentum* $\Delta p$ that occurs in time $\Delta t$
$$F=\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$$
This equation allows for the possibility of a changing mass

**collision** - any event in which two or more objects *move towards each other* and *exert forces on each other*. 

A collision in which the *total* kinetic energy before and after the collision *is the same* is called an **elastic collision**. All other can be described as **inelastic**. 

A collision after which the colliding objects *stick together* is called a **totally inelastic collision**. (*In a totally inelastic collision, the maximum possible amount of kinetic energy is transferred from the moving objects to the environment*.)

**explosion** - any event in which internal forces within a stationary system result in separate parts of the system moving apart
