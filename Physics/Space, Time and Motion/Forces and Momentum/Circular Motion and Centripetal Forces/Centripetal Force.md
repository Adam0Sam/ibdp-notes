 The name given to any *[[Forces and Momentum|force]]* which results in a motion along a **circular path**

A *centripetal force* continuously changes direction so that it is always acting perpendicularly to the instantaneous velocity

> [!Warning] Centripetal force is *not* a different type of force
> ... like for example, tension or gravity. It is simply a way of describing the results of a force. Centripetal force should not be labelled as such in a free-body diagram.

> [!Tip] A resultant force causes and acceleration $a$
> therefore the *centripetal force* towards the center of any circular motion must result in a [[Centripetal Acceleration]] (*also towards the center of the circle*)


from [[Newton's Laws of Motion|Newton's Second Law of Motion]], the [[Centripetal Acceleration]], the force acting on a mass $m$ is...
$$F = ma = \frac{mv^2}{r} = m\omega^2r$$
