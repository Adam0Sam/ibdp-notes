$$v=\frac{2\pi r}{T}$$
where $v$ is the *linear velocity*,
$r$ - the *radius* of the circle 
and $T$ - the *time period* of the the repeating motion (the time taken for one complete rotation)

$f$ is the frequency of the motion (the number of rotations in unit time *per second*) $f = \frac{1}{T}$

> [!Tip] In the context of [[#uniform circular motion]], the vector nature of [[Angular velocity]] is not important
> 

$$\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} = 2\pi f$$

from this we can express $v$ as 
$$v = \omega r$$
