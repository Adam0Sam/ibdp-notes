The constantly changing velocity of any object moving along a [[Circular Motion and Centripetal Forces|circular path]] is equivalent to an **acceleration** towards the center of the circle

> [!Tip] Remember
> The **acceleration** means a *change of velocity*, and the velocity of a mass can change by going *faster*, going *slower*, or *changing direction*.
 
$$a = \frac{v^2}{r} = \omega^2r = \frac{4\pi^2r}{T^2}$$
#todo proof of a=v^2/r
