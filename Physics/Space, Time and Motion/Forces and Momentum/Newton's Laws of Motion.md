> ### First Law
> An object will remain at rest or continue to move in a straight line at a constant speed (*the object will be in translational equilibrium*), unless a resultant force acts on it

> ### Second Law
> A resultant force is proportional to acceleration
> $$F=ma, \quad F \propto a$$
> Under this framework, mass is a measure of **inertia** (*an object's resistence to motion*)

> ### Third Law
> Whenever one body exerts a force on another body, the second body exerts a force of the same magnitude but opposite direction on the first body
