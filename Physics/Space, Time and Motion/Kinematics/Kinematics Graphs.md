The [[Gradient|gradients]] of graphs can reveal properties tied to the graphs

#### s/t

- The gradient of a displacement–time graph represents velocity.
- The gradient of a distance–time graph represents speed.

#### v/t

- The acceleration of an object is equal to the gradient of the velocity–time graph.

- The area under the graph is the traveled distance/displacement

#### a/t

- The area under an acceleration–time graph is equal to the change of velocity.
