For [[Wave Behaviour|waves]], [[energy]], particles, fields spreading equally in all directions from a point source without [[Transmission, Absorption, Scattering|absorption or scattering]], the intensity is inversely proportional to the distance squared 
$$I\propto\frac{1}{x^2}, \ \text{or}, \quad lx^2=\text{constant}$$
