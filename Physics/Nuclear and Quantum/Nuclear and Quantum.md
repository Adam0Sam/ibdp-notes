> For positively charged alpha particles, which carry a *very* large amount of energy relative to their size, to be repelled, must experience a strong electrostatic repulsive force near the nucleus, meaning that it is also positively charged.

> [!tip] Standard Atom Model
> In the standard model, electrons orbit the nucleus because of the [[centripetal force]] provided by the electrical attraction between opposite [[Electric Charge|charges]]. 
> 
> If electrons were not in [[Circular Motion and Centripetal Forces|circular motion]], the electrostatic force of attraction would accelerate them towards the nucleus
