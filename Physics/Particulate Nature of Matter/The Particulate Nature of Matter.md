The essential idea that all matter contains countless billions of particles constantly moving (*in various ways*), with [[Forces and Momentum|forces]] between them when they get close, is the backbone of the microscopic **kinetic theory of matter**. 

A common mistake in this field is to use interchangeably the concepts of [[Temperature]], [[Internal Energy]] and [[Thermal Energy]] 

> [!Info] Macroscopic understanding of temperature
 > The [[Heating and Cooling|resultant flow]] of [[thermal energy]] is always from *higher* temperature to *lower* temperature
 > 
 > Two objects in *thermal contact* and at different temperatures will reach a *thermal equilibrium*

> [!Tip] Microscopic understanding of temperature
> Gas particles, when heated up, posses a higher kinetic energy. Thus a body reaches *thermal equilibrium* when all particles reach the same average kinetic energy via [[Momentum|collisions]]. 
> 
> Ergo, Temperature ($K$) is proportional to the average random translational kinetic energy, $\bar{E_k}$ of particles (*in a gas*)

> (It must be noted that particles in gases are usually molecules and thus have [[Internal Energy|other forms]] of kinetic energy, line *rotational and vibrational*)

The [[Boltzmann constant]] was discovered to be the linking concept between the macroscopic and microscopic understandings of temperature  

When it comes to gases, [[Gas Laws|gas laws]] mandate their behaviour

Particles may also be [[Electric Charge|charged]], thus forming the foundation for [[Currents and Circuits]]
