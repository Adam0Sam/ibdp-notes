A perfect **black body** is the term we use to describe an object which has a surface which absorbs all of the infrared and light (and other [[Electromagnetic Waves|electromagnetic]] radiation) that falls on it.

A perfect black body emits the maximum possible [[thermal radiation]], which is best described graphically by a *black-body emission spectrum*

> As temperatures increase, more power is emitted and the wavelength at which the maximum power is emitted, $\lambda_{max}$, becomes smaller
> 
> e.g., at $3000K$, only a small proportion of emitted radiation is visible light. 
> 
> From this we observe **[[Wien's displacement law]]**

> [!Warning] Black bodies are not necessarily black
> Note that ‘perfect’ emitters are called black bodies, but that does not mean that they will always appear black. The Sun has a surface temperature of about 5800 K and it is a good example of a black body, so we may assume that it absorbs all the radiation falling on it; however, it is so hot that it emits enormous quantities of visible light. We are familiar with the visible spectrum, but its full black-body spectrum extends into the infrared and ultraviolet.

The exact relationship between emitted power and the combination of surface area and temperature is evident in the [[Stefan-Boltzmann Law]]
