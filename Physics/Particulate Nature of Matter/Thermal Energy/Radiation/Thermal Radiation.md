All matter/objects emit [[electromagnetic waves]] because of the movement of charged particles within their atoms. This process is *thermal radiation*. 

> [!Tip] Most commonly..
> this radiation is infrared but if temperature is hot enough, visible [[Light Waves|light]] is also emitted

> [!Info] The power of the emitted radiation depends on

> 2. Surface area
> 3. Nature of the surface

Any surface which is a good absorber of radiation (*for example, black surfaces*) will also be a good emitter. A perfect **[[Black Bodies|black body]]** is a term used to describe a object which has a surface which absorbs *all* electromagnetic radiation that falls on it (*thus they are also perfect emitters*).

Although *black bodies* are an idealized concept, some objects come close to such an ideal, for example [[Celestial Stars]]

> [!Info] Apparent intensity
> As detailed [[Transmission, Absorption, Scattering|here]], apparent brightness, or *intensity*, is inversely proportional to the surface area covered. If we assume that the thermal radiation from stars spreads out equally in all directions (*the wavefronts become parallel*), then
