Thermal conduction (passage of [[thermal energy]]) occurs because of the [[Internal Energy|transfer of kinetic energy between particles]]. (*in solids and liquids*)

> [!Tip] Degree of conductivity
> Generally, solids are better *thermal conductors* because of the small separation between particles. 

> [!Info] Rate of transfer of thermal energy by conduction
> $$\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}=kA\frac{\Delta T}{\Delta x}$$, $\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$ is a [[Power|flow of energy per second]], so obv it is measured in watts, $T$ is the temperature difference, $A$ - area, $x$ - thickness and $k$ - the thermal conductivity of the substance ($Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$)
