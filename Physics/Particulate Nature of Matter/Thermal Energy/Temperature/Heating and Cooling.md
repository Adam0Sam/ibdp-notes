The *specific heat capacity*, $c$, of a substance is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of $1\text{kg}$ of the substance by $1\text{K}$ (or $1\text{C}\degree$)  

Obviously this means that
$$Q=cm\Delta T$$, where $Q$ is the quantity of thermal energy, $c$ - the specific heat capacity, $m$ - mass and $\Delta T$ - temperature difference 

> [!Tip] Thermal capacity
> Most objects are made from a mixture of materials, thus the pure measure of specific heat capacity is not very useful.
> 
> The term *thermal capacity* holds a similar meaning as $c$ and is expressed with $\frac{Q}{\Delta T}$

> [!Info] Phase changes
> The phase of matter in the context of heating and cooling is a definite region of space in which all the physical and chemical properties of the substance contained in that space are the same

> All thermal energy transferred during a phase change is called **latent** (*hidden*) heat, $L$, since the temperature of an object doesn't change during this period
> 
> Specific latent heat of a substance is the amount of energy transferred when $1\text{kg}$ of the substance changes phase at a constant temperature $$Q=mL$$
