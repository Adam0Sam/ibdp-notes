$${P=\frac{1}{3}Nm\frac{v^2}{V}=\frac{1}{3}\rho v^2}$$
is the equation that links the macroscopic properties of a gas (pressure and volume) to its microscopic properties (the number of particles, their mass and their speed) ( #todo links to relevant notes)

#### Proof
Consider a box with dimension $x$, $y$ and $z$ and within it a particle of mass $m$ and velocity $v$

After the particle has an elastic collision with the wall its change in velocity becomes: $v-(-v)=2v$

Now, the average force on the end wall, $F=\text{change of momentum}=m\cdot 2v=2mv$

Time interval between collisions of the particle with the same wall, $t=\frac{2x}{v}$

$$\text{average force on end wall}=\frac{\text{change of momentum}}{\text{time between collisions}}=\frac{2mv}{\frac{2x}{v}}=\frac{mv^2}{x}$$ then the average pressure on the end wall becomes $$P=\frac{\text{average force}}{\text{area}}=\frac{\frac{mv^2}{x}}{yz}=\frac{mv^2}{xyz}=\frac{mv^2}{V}$$
However, of course, the container may not be rectangular, and all gases have a very large number of particles moving in random directions with different speeds.

- If there are $N$ particles in the box, all moving perpendicular to the end wall, the average pressure on the end wall becomes $\frac{Nmv^2}{V}$
- If the particles are moving in random directions, the avg pressure becomes $\frac{1}{3}\frac{Nmv^2}{V}$, because there are three perpendicular directions
