Ideal (*monatomic*) gases do not have any potential energies or vibrational/rotational kinetic energies. Thus we can derive the [[internal energy]] of a monatomic ideal gas by multiplying the number of particles by their average random translational kinetic energy  $$U=N\cdot\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
Observe from [[Behaviour of Ideal Gases]], that $${P=\frac{1}{3}Nm\frac{v^2}{V}}$$ and as such $${PV=\frac{1}{3}Nmv^2=\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{1}{2}Nmv^2=\frac{2}{3}U}$$
From this it becomes apparent that an alternative law exists for the [[Ideal Gas Law]], which relates the internal energy of monatomic gases ant their temperature
$$U=\frac{3}{2}nRT$$

If we divide this equation by the number of particles $N$, we get the value of the [[Boltzmann constant]] and a subsequent equation linking the microscopic and macroscopic behaviour of gases. This realization enables us to use the Boltzmann constant instead of the [[Ideal Gas Law|universal molar gas constant]], because $k_b=\frac{nR}{N}$
$$U=\frac{3}{2}Nk_bT$$


> [!Warning] Most gases consist of molecules, rather than atoms
> Thus they still approximate well to the macroscopic [[Ideal Gas Law|behaviour of an ideal gas]], but their internal energy is more complicated, because of the vibrational and rotational kinetic energies of their molecules
