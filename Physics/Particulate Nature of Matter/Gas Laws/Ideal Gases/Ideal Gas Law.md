$$PV=nRT$$, where $n$ - moles and $R\text{, the universal (molar) gas constant} = 8.31\text{ JK}^{-1}\text{mol}^{-1}$

This is the macroscopic equivalent to the [[Boltzmann constant]]

> [!Tip] Relation to the Gas Laws
As empirically deduced with the three [[gas laws]], the equation shows *direct* proportionality between [[Pressure]] and/or Volume and [[Temperature]] and an inverse proportionality between Pressure and Volume

If a gas obeys this relationship perfectly, it is called an **[[Ideal Gases|ideal gas]]**

> [!Example] A Pressure-Volume diagram
> The abscissa and the ordinate are Volume and Pressure, respectively, while different Isotherms relate to different constant temperatures

> [!Tip] A different interpretation of this law can be found in the [[Internal Energy of Ideal Gases]] derivation
