Assumptions about the particles (*usually molecules but still..*) in an ideal gas
- The gas contains a very large number of identical particles
- The volume of the particles is negligible compared with the total volume occupied by the gas
- The particles are moving in [[Boltzmann constant|random directions]], with a wide variety of speeds
- There are no forces between particles, except when they collide. (Because there are no forces, the particles have no [[Energy|(electrical) potential energy]])
- The motion of the particles obeys Newton's laws of motion
- All collisions between particles are elastic (*This means that the total kinetic energy of the particles remains constant a the same temperature*)


This simplified form of assumptions allows us to derive a [[Behaviour of Ideal Gases]] and [[Internal Energy of Ideal Gases]]

> [!Warning] Ideal Gases are a concept
> Most gases the [[Ideal Gas Law]] under most circumstances, however if their pressure or density is very high (leading to non-negligible inter-particle forces) or the temperature is very low (once again, greater forces between particles), the initial assumptions will be non-binding and so will the gas law
