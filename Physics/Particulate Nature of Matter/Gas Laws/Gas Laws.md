Because we can usually assume that there are no forces acting between molecules (except in collisions) the physical properties of gases are much easier to study and understand than solids and liquids.

Given most conditions, all gases show similar physical behaviour under the (*universal*) **gas laws**.

The three empirical gas laws described above can be combined into one relationship/equation:
$$\text{For a fixed amount of gas, } PV\propto T$$
or
$$\frac{P_1V_1}{T_1}=\frac{P_2V_2}{T_2}$$
we can further breakdown this relationship with the **[[Ideal Gas Law]]**
$$PV=nRT$$
If a gas obeys this law perfectly, it is called an [[Ideal Gases|Ideal Gas]], and as such it becomes simpler to mathematically model the [[Behaviour of Ideal Gases|behaviour of such gases]], a related conclusion is observed in analysing the [[Internal Energy of Ideal Gases]]
