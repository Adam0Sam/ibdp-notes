For a fixed amount of gas at constant volume; $$P\propto T$$
Similarly as with [[Boyle's Law]], if the pressure and/or temperature of a fixed amount of gas are changed the equality $$\frac{P_1}{T_1}=\frac{P_2}{T_2}$$
holds true

> [!Tip] Absolute Zero
It is observed that that all gasses exert zero pressure at $-273\degree C$, or $0\degree K$, the lower boundary of the [[kelvin scale]]
