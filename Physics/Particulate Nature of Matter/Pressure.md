Pressure is defined as perpendicular (*or normal*) force per unit area: $$P=\frac{F}{A}, \quad 1\text{Pa}=1\text{Nm}^{-2}$$
### Pressure in [[Gas Laws|gases]]
 Each collision of a molecule with the containing walls creates a tiny outwards force
 
 Because molecular [[Boltzmann constant|motions are random]], each collision can result in a different sized force, but the enormous number of molecules colliding every second with a small area means the average force/area will stay the same, thus pressure is constant

> [!Warning] Molecule collisions
> Molecules also collide with other molecules but this simply [[Momentum|re-directs their motion]] and has no other overall effect

> [!Example] $\text{Atmospheric pressure}=1.0\cdot 10^5\text{Pa}$
