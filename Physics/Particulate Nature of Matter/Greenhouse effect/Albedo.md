The surface of any planet or moon will reflect / scatter some of the thermal radiation that is incident upon it (arrives at the surface). We use the term albedo to quantify this: $$\text{albedo} = \frac{\text{total scattered power}}{\text{total incident power}}$$
An albedo of 1 would represent a surface which scatters all of the incident thermal radiation

> [!Tip] The variations...
> The albedo of a surface varies with the angle at which the incident radiation strikes the surface: albedo increases as the radiation is incident at greater angles to the perpendicular
