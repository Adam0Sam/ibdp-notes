Since planets of the Solar System have existed for billions of years, it is reasonable to assume that they should each have reached a steady (average) temperature, over human timescales at least $$
 \begin{align}
 \text{Radiant thermal energy received by a cosmic object} &= \\ \text{radiant thermal energy emitted by a cosmic object}
\end{align}
$$
The value of the intensity of [[thermal radiation]] (including [[Light Waves|light]]) from the sun which passes perpendicularly through an area just above Earth's surface is called the **Solar Constant**, $S=1.36\cdot 10^3\text{ Wm}^{-2}$

The mean value of radiated intensity directed at the surface of the planet thus comes out as $$S\cdot \frac{\pi r^2}{4 \pi r^2} = \frac{S}{4}$$
Of course, only the sun can be considered a [[Black Bodies|black body]], the same is not true for planets, moons, etc. To quantify the ability of all cosmic object to [[Transmission, Absorption, Scattering|absorb, reflect and scatter]] and emit thermal radiation, concepts of [[Albedo]] and [[Emissivity]] ar used. With this in mind the relationship between energy received and emitted becomes $$S \cdot \text{cross sectional area} \cdot (1-\text{albedo})=\text{emissivity} \cdot \sigma AT^4$$
#todo more on cross sectional area vs surface area

> [!Example] [[Wien's Displacement Law]] in action
> Compared to radiation from the Sun, the thermal radiation from the Earth is at a much lower power, with much longer wavelengths
