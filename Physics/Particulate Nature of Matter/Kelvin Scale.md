A temperature at which the [[Energy|kinetic energy]] of all particles reduces to zero is known as **absolute zero** on the Kelvin scale. ($0K=-273.15 \degree C$)

The upper fixed point on the Kelvin scale uses the melting point of pure water which, for convenience, is given the value of $+273.15K$

$K=\degree C + 273$
