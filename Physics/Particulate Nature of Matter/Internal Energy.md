This is the name given to the enormous amount of energy which exists within all matter because of the random motions and positions of the particles it contains

If the average separation of the particles (*in a solid or liquid*) increases, so too does their potential energy 
> [!Warning] This is true up to a certain point.
> The potential forces in gasses are negligible because of the larger separation between molecules

If the [[Temperature]] of a body rises, so does the kinetic energy of the particles
> [!Example] Forms of kinetic particle energy
> - Vibrational kinetic energy
> - Translational kinetic energy
> - Rotational kinetic energy
