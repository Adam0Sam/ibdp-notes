The *voltage*, or *potential difference*, of a battery, or other source of electrical energy, is a measure of how much energy it can supply to the [[Electric Current|charge carriers]] flowing through it.

The electric potential difference, $V$, is the work done per unit charge on moving a positive charge between two points along the path of the current
$$
V =\frac{W}{q}
$$
