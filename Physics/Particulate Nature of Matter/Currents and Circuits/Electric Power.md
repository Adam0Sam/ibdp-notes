If there is a [[Voltage|potential difference]] across some resistor, then every charge of some coulombs (depending on the [[Electric Current|current]]) that passes is doing work by dissipating energy to the resistor, or, generating electric power 

$$
\begin{align}
&\frac{W}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t} \times \frac{W}{\Delta q} \Rightarrow  \\
&P=IV \quad \text{or, since } V=IR \\
&P= I^{2}R=\frac{V^{2}}{R}
\end{align}
$$

Whenever any current passes through any resistance, energy will be trabsferred to internal energy and then transferred as thermal energy
