The two fundamental laws are [[#the current law]] and [[#the voltage law]]

### The Current Law

For any junction, the sum of [[Electric Current|currents]] flowing into that junction is equal to the sum of currents flowing out

$$
\sum I = 0,
$$
where current going in is positive and current going out is negative

### The Voltage Law

The sum of the voltages around any closed loop in a circuit is 0

$$
\sum V = 0
$$
If the loop points in the direction of the [[Electric Current|current]], the battery adds [[voltage]] and [[Electrical Resistance|resistors]] subtract voltage, conversely, if the loop points in the opposite direction of current, the battery subtracts and resistors add
