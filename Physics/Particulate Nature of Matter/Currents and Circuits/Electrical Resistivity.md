Given that no significant temperature changes occur, the following conclusions can be made

1. The resistance of a uniform wire is proportional to its length, $l$ (*assuming its thickness and temperature does not change*)

2. The resistance of a uniform wire is inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area, $A$ (*assuming the wire has constant length and temperature does not change*)

3. The resistance of a uniform wire depends on the metal from which it is made

Combining the results we get that $R\propto \frac{l}{A}$ or $R=\text{constant}\cdot \frac{l}{A}$, where the constant depends on the resistive properties of the particular metal.

As such
$$
\text{resistivity}, \rho = \frac{RA}{l}
$$
> [!tip] The resistance of a material, like a wire, depends on its shape
> For this reason, $\rho$ is defined as the resistance of a length of $1\mathrm{m}$ and cross-sectional area of $1\mathrm{m}^{2}$ 

> [!example] Variation of resistivity with temperature
> The resistivity of metals will increase with temperature because of the increased vibrations of metal ions. The number of charge carriers in metal will not increase significantly unless temperatures are extreme
> 
> The number of charge carriers in non-metals, however, can increase significantly, so the materials' resistance can in tandem decrease with increasing temperatures
