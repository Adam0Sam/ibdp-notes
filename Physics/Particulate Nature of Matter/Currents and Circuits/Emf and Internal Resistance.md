The electromotive force (**emf**) of a battery, or any other source of electrical energy, is defined as the total energy transferred in the source per unit charge passing through it.

> [!example] 
> A battery with an emf of $12\mathrm{V}$ can transfer a total of $12\mathrm{J}$ to every [[Electric Charge|coulomb of charge]]

However, cells batteries and other sources of electrical energy are not perfect conductors of electricity. The materials from which the sources are made will have **internal resistance**, given by $r$ (which is typically less than $1\ohm$)

Due to this internal resistance, the magnitude of the [[Voltage|potential difference]] across the circuit (*or terminal p.d.*) will *lose volts*, so emf, the *total* electromotive force (even though it is not really a force) equates to 
$$
\epsilon = V_{t} + V_{r} = IR+Ir
$$
