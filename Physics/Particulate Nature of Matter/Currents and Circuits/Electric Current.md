In order for a [[Electric Charge|charged]] particle to flow as part of an electric current (and be classified as a charge carrier) it has to be mobile.

> [!example] Mobile Charge Carriers
> Some of the electrons in the atoms of metals have enough energy that they are no longer attracted to a particular metal ion. We say that they are delocalized electrons, or free electrons.

> When there is no electric current, the free electrons move around randomly at high speeds, much like [[Ideal Gases|gas particles]], but when they form an electric current, a slower drift speed in the direction of the current is added to the random movement

The magnitude of an electric current, $I$, is the amount of [[Electric Charge|charge]] that passes a point in unit time
$$
I =\frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t}
$$

When a current only flows in one direction it is called a direct current (DC). Alternating Current (AC), on the other hand, continuously change direction
