Components can be connected in [[#Series connection|series]], in [[#Parallel Connection|parallel]] or as a combination of the two

### Series Connection

In this connection, all the current flows in the same path. Due to the law of conservation of charge, the charge per second flowing into each resistor must be the same as the current flowing out of each resistor, thus
$$
\text{Currents in a series: } \quad I=I_{1}=I_{2}
$$
Likewise, the sum of the separate potential differences must equal the potential difference across them all, so
$$
\text{Potential differences in a series: }\quad V=V_{1}+V_{2}+\dots
$$
Because $V=IR$ (from [[Electrical Resistance]])
$$
\begin{align}
&V=IR_{s}=IR_{1}+IR_{2}+\dots \\
& \therefore R_{s}=R_{1}+R_{2}+\dots
\end{align}
$$
### Parallel Connection

The current splits into three and they follow different paths between the same two points. Because the resistors are all connected between the same two points, they must all have the same potential difference across them
$$
V=V_{1}=V_{2}
$$
The law of conservation of charge means that
$$
I=I_{1}+I_{2}+\dots
$$
Again, since $I=\frac{V}{R}$
$$
\begin{align}
&\frac{V}{R_{p}}=\frac{V}{R_{1}}+\frac{V}{R_{2}}+\frac{V}{R_{3}} \\
&\therefore \frac{1}{R_{p}}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}+\frac{1}{R_{3}}
\end{align}
$$
