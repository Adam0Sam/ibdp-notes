One of the few conservation rules in physics relates to the consistency of total [[Electric Charge|charge]] in an isolated system

Whenever charges flow from place to place we describe it as an [[Electric Current|electric current]], where the term *charge carrier* is often used to describe any moving charge. 

In order for there to be a continuous flow of current, electrical components and wires are need to form complete (closed loop), called an [[Electric Circuits|electric circuit]]


When the same potential difference ([[voltage]]) is connected across different electrical components, the currents produced will vary due to [[Electrical Resistance]]

[[Emf and Internal Resistance]]
