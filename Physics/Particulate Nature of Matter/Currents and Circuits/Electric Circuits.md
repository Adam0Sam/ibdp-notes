A single battery is described as an electric cell. When more than one cell is used, the combination is called a battery. 

The positive terminal of the battery attracts free electrons but, for historic reasons, electric current is always shown flowing from the positive terminal to the negative terminal around any circuit

Combining [[Combinations of Resistors|two or more components in the same circuit]] results in different distributions of [[Electric Current|current]], [[Voltage|voltage]] and [[Electrical Resistance|resistance]]

Although not part of the curriculum, [[Kirchoff's Laws]] are extremely helpful
