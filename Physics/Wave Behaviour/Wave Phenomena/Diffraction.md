Waves will tend to spread around corners as they pass through gaps (*apartures*). This effect is known as **diffraction**.

> Diffraction effect are most significant when the size of aparture or object $\approx$ wavelength.

> If aparture width is much greater than the wavelength, diffraction usually becomes insignificant 
 

> [!Example] Examples of diffraction
> - A typical sound wave may have a wavelength of about $1m$. This is similar to the size of everyday objects and thus we expect to be able to hear sources that we cannot see
