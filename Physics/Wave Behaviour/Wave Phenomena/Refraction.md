Waves usually change speed, $v$, when they travel into a different medium. Such changes of speed may result in a change of direction for the wave, especially when different parts of the wavefront reach the boundary at different times

> [!Example] This is called *refraction* - a change in direction that occurs when a wave changes speed

The amount of refraction that occurs is represented numerically by the *refractive index*, $n$
$$n=\frac{c}{v}$$

> [!Tip] The critical angle
> If a wave is leaving a denser medium, at a certain angle, the refracted ray will be refracted at angle of $90\degree$ . This angle is called the critical angle, $\theta_c$

> For all angles of incidence greater than the critical angle, all light will be reflected back and remain in the denser medium. his is known as *total internal reflection*. 
> $$\frac{n_1}{n_2}=\frac{1}{\sin\theta_c}$$, with $n_1$ being the refractive index of the denser medium
