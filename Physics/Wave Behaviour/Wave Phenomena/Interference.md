When the [[Wave Superposition|superposition of waves]] produces a constant two or three dimensional pattern, we describe it as an *interference pattern*.

To explain interference patterns, we need to consider the *path differences* between the waves arriving at various points from the two sources.

Because of this *path difference*, two extreme possibilities (*all other cases fall in between these two*) of wave superposition outlined [[#Constructive]] and [[#Destructive]]

### Constructive
When the path difference of the arriving waves is $$n\lambda, \ n\in \mathbb{Z}$$
the waves themselves arrive *in phase* at thus constructive interference is observed

### Destructive
When one wave has traveled $n + \frac{1}{2}$ more distance, it will become out of phase and thus result in *destructive interference*
$$\text{path difference}=(n+\frac{1}{2})\lambda$$
