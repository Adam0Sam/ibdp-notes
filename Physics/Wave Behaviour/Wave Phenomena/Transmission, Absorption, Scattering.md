  The process in which waves are able to travel through a medium is described as wave **transmission**. 
> [!Tip] During transmission through a medium, there is often an absorption of energy
> Waves may also be randomly misdirected by interactions with irregularities within the medium (**scattering**)

> Mediums, in respect to waves, can either be *transparent* or *opaque*

> [!Info] As waves spread out, their [[energy]] is dissipated, the [[power]] that they transfer is reduced
> $$I=\frac{P}{A}$$
> where $I$ is intensity ($Wm^{-2}$), $P$ is power, and $A$ - covered surface area

> #todo why is it so?
> Generally speaking, the energy transferred is proportional to the wave's amplitude squared
> $$I \propto x_0^2$$

> > **In two dimensions**
> > As surface waves spread away, the wavefront, and thus the energy transferred, is spread over a greater arc length
> 
> > **In three dimensions**
> > The intensity of any waves spreading radially in three dimensions, without absorption, from a point follows an [[Inverse Square Law|inverse square relationship]]

> > If the waves begin covering a great distance from their point source, the wavefronts will become almost parallel and thus no loss of energy due to spreading will be noticable
