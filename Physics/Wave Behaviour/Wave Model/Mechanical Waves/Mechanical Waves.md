A mechanical travelling [[Wave Model|wave]] can be described as an [[oscillations|oscillating]] disturbance that travels away from its source through the surrounding *medium* (solid, liquid or gas) transferring [[Energy|energy]] from one place to another. Most importantly, waves transfer energy without transferring the matter itself.
