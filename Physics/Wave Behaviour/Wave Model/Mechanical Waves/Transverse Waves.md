In a **transverse wave**, each part of the medium oscillates *perpendicularly* to the direction in which the wave is transferring [[energy]]

Each particle is [[oscillations|oscillating]] with the same amplitude and frequency but each particle is slightly out of phase with its neighbour

The tops of the transverse waves are called **crests**, while the bottoms of the waves are called **throughs**


> Transverse mechanical waves *cannot* travel through liquids (because of the random nature of molecular movements), as opposed to [[longitudinal waves]]
