All waves involve [[oscillations]] and they can be either **[[Mechanical Waves|mechanical]]** or **[[Electromagnetic Waves|electromagnetic]]**

**[[Mechanical Waves]]** - Involve the oscillations of masses

**[[Electromagnetic Waves]]** - involve the oscillations of [[electric and magnetic fields]]

> The concept of wavelength $\lambda$ is central to the study of waves

>  One wavelength is the shortest distance between two points moving in phase


the wave speed, $v$, thus can be [[Simple Harmonic Motion (SMH)|defined]] as follows
$$v=f\lambda = \frac{\lambda}{T}$$

Two basic kinds of both [[Mechanical Waves|mechanical]] and [[Electromagnetic Waves|electromagnetic]] waves exist: *[[Transverse Waves|transverse]]* and *[[Longitudinal Waves|longitudinal]]*

idk this wasnt in the textbook

$$v=\omega\sqrt{x_0^2-x^2}$$
