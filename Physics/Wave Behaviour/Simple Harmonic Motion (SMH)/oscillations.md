An **oscillation** is a regularly repeated backwards-and-forwards movement about the *same central point*, and along the *same path*

Oscillations occur when a mass, displaced from its *equilibrium position ($F_R=0$)*, experiences a resultant *restoring* force moving it back to its *equilibrium position*
