**Simple harmonic motion** is a simplified theoretical model representing [[oscillations]] in which the acceleration is proportional, in magnitude, to the displacement but opposite in direction 
$$a \propto -x$$

> [!Tip] In perfect SHM...
> The oscillations always take the same time (*they are isochronous*) and there are no resistive forces, so that they continue oscillating indefinitely with no loss of energy and constant amplitude

> [!Info] SHM will occur in... 
> - For an [[Mass-spring system|oscillating mass]] on a spring which obeys [[Elastic Restoring force|Hooke's Law]], the condition of $a \propto -x$ is clearly satisfied
> - For a [[simple pendulum]], the restoring force, $mgsin\theta$, is (almost) proportional to the displacement angle, $\theta$, if the angle is small 

>The **amplitude**, $X_0$, of an oscillation is its maximum displacement while oscillating ($E_k$ is lowest)

> $T = \frac{1}{f}$, where $T$ is the time taken to complete an oscillation ($s$). Both $T$ and $f$ often remain constant

Closely related to SHM is [[Circular Motion and Centripetal Forces|circular motion]], to the point that one complete oscillation can be considered equivalent to a particle moving through an angle of $2\pi$

From [[Angular velocity]], we consider **[[angular frequency]]**

> [!Tip] The defining equation of SHM
> In SHM, amplitude does not affect the time period, thus it can be observed that $$a = -\omega^2x$$

> We can see that there is a phase difference of $\frac{\pi}{2}$ between displacement and velocity and a phase difference of $\pi$ between displacement and acceleration
