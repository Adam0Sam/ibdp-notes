The time period of such a system is
$$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$$
or $$\omega^2=\frac{k}{m}$$
>[!Warning]
>This equation applies perfectly only to a point mass acted upon by a separate simple spring system that has a well defined stiffness $k$ and no *significant* mass

The total [[Mechanical Energy|energy]] of this system can be expressed as 
$$E_p = \frac{1}{2}k(x_0)^2$$
