This is a phenomenon that is observed when there is relative motion between a source and an observer of [[Wave Model|waves]].

### Mechanical Waves
When the doppler effect is observed in [[mechanical waves]] the *received* frequency, $f'$ becomes greater than the *emitted* frequency $f$. 

Since the [[Wave Model|speed of mechanical waves]] is constant, the *received wavelength*, $\lambda$, will be proportionally smaller

### Electromagnetic Waves
The following equation can be used if the relative speed between the source and the observer, $v$, is very much less than the [[Electromagnetic Waves|speed of electromagnetic waves]], $c$. (Which is often times the case due to the very high value of $c$)

$$\frac{\Delta f}{f}=\frac{\Delta\lambda}{\lambda}\approx\frac{v}{c}$$
Here $\Delta f$ and $\Delta\lambda$ are *shifts (changes) in* *frequency* and *wavelength*

When applied to Radar or similar technologies a factor of $2$ should be added next to $v$ because the wave travels *back and forth*
