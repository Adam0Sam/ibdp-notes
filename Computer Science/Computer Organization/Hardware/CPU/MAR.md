Memory Address Register (MAR), a register contained within the [[CU]], holds the memory address of the data used by the [[ALU]], so that the [[CU]] can fetch the corresponding content from the [[Computer Hardware|primary memory]] 

The MAR also holds the future addresses of processed data. 

In order for the MAR to communicate with [[Computer Hardware|primary memory]], a connection via *the Memory (Address) Bus* is necessary.
