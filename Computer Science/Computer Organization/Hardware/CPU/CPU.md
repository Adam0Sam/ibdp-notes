The CPU is a hardware component of a computer system and can perform: *basic arithmetic*, *logical* and/or *i/o* operations in order to *process* data from input devices 

Regarding the phases of the [[Computer Organization|IPO model]], the CPU functions in the *process* (obv), *output* (more on that) and *storage* models (retrieving and storing data).

Any data or info that can be accessed and saved from a storage medium first has to pass through the *primary memory*. As such the CPU can only retrieve data from *input* and/or *primary memory* of the computer system
