Similar to [[RAM]], except ROM (read only memory) is used to store permanent instructions and data that cannot be changed. Nothing can be altered in the ROM, therefore its **not** general-purpose. 

ROM is considered **non-volatile**, therefore data/instructions in the ROM are usually used to boot and operate the OS

ROM is generally *much* smaller than RAM
