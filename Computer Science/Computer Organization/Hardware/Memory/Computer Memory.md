1. **primary** - the memory that the [[CPU]] *can* access directly, composed of [[RAM]] and [[ROM]]. This includes both data and instructions (in binary machine code)
2. **secondary/auxiliary** - the memory the [[CPU]] *can't* access directly. Relative to primary, its slow but also *non-volatile/persistent*. Also in comparison to primary, secondary storage has a *high capacity* ![[Pasted image 20240424200618.png]]

> [!Tip] Virtual Memory
> Modern OSs are advanced and allow a seemingly large amount of processes to run concurrently. When a new execution is requested an idle execution is stored in **Secondary Memory** while the new execution is copied into **Primary Memory**. 
> 
> Secondary Memory when used as a store for previous primary memory processes is called *Virtual Memory*
