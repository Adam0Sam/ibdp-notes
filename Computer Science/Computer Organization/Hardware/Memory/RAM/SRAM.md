Static RAM (SRAM) is faster but also more expensive than [[DRAM]]. As such, only a small amount of SRAM is placed between the main [[RAM]] and the [[CPU]] and it is called **cache**. 

Cache temporarily stores the most actively used/accessed instructions and data so that the [[CU]] does not need to access the [[DRAM|slower main memory]]

> [!Example] Cache Levels
> 1. L1 (first-level) cache is placed on the microprocessor itself and is small enough to provide a one/two-cycle access time
> 2. L2 (second-level) cache is placed between [[DRAM]] and the microprocessor. It's larger but also slower than L1 cache
>    
>    #todo more on cycle access time
