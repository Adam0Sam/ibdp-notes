RAM (random access memory) is a **general-purpose** storage area, meaning that the data stored can be overwritten, allowing for data to be loaded for execution whenever it becomes necessary.

However, RAM is **volatile**. Whenever power is lost, the contents of its memory are wiped.

Random Access Memory stores the executing program instructions as well as any data that is needed. 

Data/Instructions are stored in unique memory locations and every such location has an address (used by the [[CU]] to find, retrieve and access the data to send to the [[ALU]]) as well as content.
