Data compression reduces the size of files to be transmitted over a [[Networks|network]] (conserving [[Network Speed|bandwidth]])

**Lossy** data compression fundamentally loses some amount of information

**Lossless** data compression reduces the number of bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. There is no loss of information during lossless compression

> [!example] Examples of formats that use compression
> - Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) uses lossless compression (when dealing with a graphic file that has fewer than 256 colours)
> - Mp3 is an audio coding format that uses lossy compression
> - MPEG-2 combines lossy audio and video data compression
