Standard protocols ensure the ability of different hardware and software systems to communicate

> [!info] What Protocols Guarantee
> - Data Integrity (via checksum mechanisms)
> - Source Integrity (validated identity of sender, via digital signatures)
> - Flow Control (manage limited infra and bandwidth, and [[Network Speed|network speed]] in general, via the transportation [[Network Layers|layer]])
> - Congestion Management (when a request exceeds offered capacity by a network)
> - Deadlock Prevention (when two or more network competing actions are each waiting for the other to finish and thus neither does, via the *perisistance timer*)
> - Error Checking (same as Data Integrity?)
> - Error Correction (same as Data Integrity?)
