A computer network is comprised of two or more computer systems ([[Servers|servers]] and [[Clients|clients]]) that are connected and able to communicate and exchange data (usually in the form of [[Data Packets]]) via either [[Wired Communication Mediums|cable]] or [[Wireless Communication Mediums|wireless]] media.

There are a number of ways to create a network, with the three fundamental components being: [[Hub]], [[Switch]], [[Router]] (even though they come bundled in a single box).

For the [[Different Types of Networks]] that can be established, every computer uses a specific process to transfer or receive data from a connection medium, notably via the established [[OSI]] reference model and [[TCP-IP]] protocol model.
