The main unit of network speed measurement is bits per second (with kbps or Mbps being multiples of $10^{3}$ and $10^{6}$)

The *theoretical* speed of data in a medium is called **bandwidth** and it depends on the signalling technique used and the physical properties of the medium

The *actual* transfer rate is **throughput** and it is affected by various factors such as interference, traffic, the number of connected devices and errors.

In a network with many segments the *slowest* segment creates a **bottleneck** that affects the throughput of the network. (**throughput** is only as fast as the slowest link of the path)

**Goodput** measures the transfer rate of usable data.
