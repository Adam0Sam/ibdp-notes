1. **Modem** - connects to the internet
2. **Wireless Network Adapter** (wireless **NIC**) is required for each device on a wireless network
3. **Wireless Antennas** - significantly increase the effective communication area of the wireless network.
4. **Wireless Repeater** (signal booster/range expander) - connects to a router or Wireless Access Point ([[Wireless Network Software Components|WAP]]) and rebroadcasts an existing signal
5. **Ethernet to [[Wireless Network Software Components|WAP]]** - uses ethernet cables to carry the signal to a WAP or Wireless Repeater
6. **Ethernet over powerline to [[Wireless Network Software Components|WAP]]** - same as Ethernet to WAP but over power lines ðŸ¤¯
