1. Microwave Radio (used extensively for mobile telephone networks and [[LAN|LANs]]). Used in satellites and bluetooth (microwave frequencies which transmit at very low power levels and change regularly)
	- Relatively high [[Network Speed|bandwidth]] (but lower than [[Wired Communication Mediums|cables]])
	- Difficult to guarantee reliability (weather may impact performance, etc)
	- Less secure than [[wired communication mediums]]
2. Infrared (only for very short distances)
	- Cannot pass through objects and is directional. A line of sight is required. 
	- Advanced security?
3. RFID? (uses various radio technologies)
4. Free Space Optics (use of lasers for wireless communication?)
