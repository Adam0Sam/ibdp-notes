1. Copper Cable (metal conductors). 
	- Most common type of cabling in computer [[networks]]
2. Coaxial Cable (two copper conductors). 
	- Low cost of installation
3. Unshielded Twister Pair Cable (UTP). 
	- Very popular in [[LAN|LANs]] 
	- Low installation cost
	- Prone to electrical interference
4. Shielded Twisted Pair Cable
	- More difficult to install than UTP
	- Reduced interference
5. Fiber Optic Cable (carries beam of light)
	- Very expensive
	- High [[Network Speed|speeds]]
	- Needs fewer repeaters
	- Extremely secure?
