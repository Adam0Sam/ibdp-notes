A hub is the connection point for devices on a single [[Networks|network]] (usually via ethernet cables to ports).

Data sent to the hub is copied and sent to all devices connected to the hub, with only the device waiting to receive the data accepting it. 

This process, while ensuring the data reaches its destination, generates a lot of traffic on the network
