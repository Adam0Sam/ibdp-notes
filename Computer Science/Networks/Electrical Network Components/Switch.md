A switch is also the connection point for multiple devices on a single [[Networks|network]]. However, unlike a [[hub]], the switch can identify which network device is connected to which port. 

This allows the switch to transmit data to the exact port and network device for which it is intended. As such, networks connected with a switch are faster than networks connected with a [[hub]].
