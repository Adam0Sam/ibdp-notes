The types of changeovers are:
##### 1. Parallel 
both work in parallel for a short period of time
- less risk, 
- if the new and old systems are relatively similar, the outputs can be compared
however, there is extra costs and workload 
##### 2. Direct/Immediate
- high risk
this method is only preferred when the system is not critical. 

of course, this is prob the cheapest option

##### 3. Pilot
Mostly used in large organizations that have multiple sites as the system can only be introduced in one site and evaluated
- low risk

##### 4. Phased
One module of the system is converted at a time
- takes longer
