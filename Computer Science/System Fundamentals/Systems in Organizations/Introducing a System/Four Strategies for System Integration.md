In the case that two different information systems merge, there are essentially four ways to go about integration

##### 1. Keep Both Information Systems (*high maintanence cost*)
##### 2. Replace Both systems with a new one (*increased initial cost*)
##### 3. Select the best pars from each system and combine them (*difficult to work with?*)
##### 4. Select One System (*policy problems*)
