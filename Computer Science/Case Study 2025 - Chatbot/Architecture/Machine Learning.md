Machine learning is when we combine data and algorithms to make predictions about future behavior. This is the programmatic analysis of past data to find patterns that are indicative of what will happen in the future

> [!example] Example of ML systems
> - Image Recognition (FaceID)
> - Speech/Audio Recognition (Siri/Shazam)
> - NLP (Google Translate)
> - Recommendation Systems (Netflix)
> - Pattern Detection/Classification (Fraud Detection/Customer Segmentation/Pedestrian Detection)

The general process of machine learning starts with the selection of a machine learning model (Linear Regression, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Neural Networks)
