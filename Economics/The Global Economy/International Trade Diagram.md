The basic [[supply]] an [[demand]] graph may outline domestic production and consumption. The introduction of the global market offers the same good at a constant price (as its assumed that the international market is at equilibrium)

> Since other countries may have better efficiency in producing a certain good, opening up a domestic market leads to increased [[consumer surplus]] (lower price)

> Domestic producers may not exceed domestic demand, thus opening up to international trade leads to higher [[producer surplus]] (higher prices)

In both cases [[allocative efficiency]] is achieved, though it does lead to a recomposition of the overall community surplus
