### Increased competition
Free trade exposes domestic firms to international competition. Under competition, companies are pressed into lowering prices and/or improving service. 

A global division of labour would lead to incredible efficiency. 

### Lower prices
A result of [[#Increased competition]]

### Increased variety/choice and acquisition of needed resources/taking advantage of different factor endowments
Free trade enables a more diverse/greater set of possible imports

### Foreign exchange earnings
Exporters generally want to be paid in their home currency. So, when foreign consumers buy a country’s exports they must also buy their currency. In doing so, the exporting country accumulates larger amounts of the foreign currency.

> [!example] 
> when Guatemala exports commodities like bananas and coffee to the USA, it earns US dollars that it can use to buy cars and capital goods from the USA and elsewhere because the dollar is easily exchanged for other currencies. For smaller and developing countries, in particular, an important feature of trade is getting access to foreign exchange that can be used to buy goods and services from other countries.


### Access to larger markets/economies of scale
Often countries find that they are so productive in a particular product that their own country’s market is too small to satisfy all the supply available.
> [!example]
> if Paraguay were to sell its soybeans only in Paraguay, with its population of just 7 million people, a massive surplus and a drop in price would result. Instead, Paraguay trades with the neighbouring countries in the MERCOSUR trade area (which includes Brazil and Argentina with combined 260 million people). Because of their access to larger markets, soybeans are a leading export.
