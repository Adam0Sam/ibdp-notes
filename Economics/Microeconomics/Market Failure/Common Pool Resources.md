Another form of [[market failure]] is the existence of common pool, or common access, resources. These are resources which are **non-excludable**, but **rivalrous**

> [!Tip] Tragedy of the Commons
> Garret Hardin warned of 'tragedy of the commons' in a his classic essay. Hardin explained that when there exist common resources, for which there is no private owner, the incentive among rational users of the resources is to exploit it to the fullest potential in order to maximise their own self-gain before the resource is depleted. 
> 
> The tragedy of the commons, therefore, is that common resources will inevitably be depleted due to humans’ rational, self-interested behaviours, leaving us with shortages in key resources essential to human survival.

> [!Example] Examples of the *free-rider problem*
> - Water sources in nearly every country are receivers of toxic waste, thus diminishing ecosystems.
> - Forests on public lands (which are owned by the ‘public’ and not any private individual) are slashed for wood and to make way for farming, which reduces oxygen production and erodes the soil.
> - The atmosphere is infused with pollutants generated from industry, cars, and the methane output of animals that are kept for meat production.
