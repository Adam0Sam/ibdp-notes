Contrary to [[Classical Economics]], [[The Free Market|free markets]] are not necessarily always efficient. *Market failure* is any situation where the allocation of resources by a free market is not (*socially*) efficient

Market failure is most often associated with the existence of [[Externalities]], [[Common Pool Resources]], public goods, asymmetric information, and market power.

> [!Info] Marginal Analysis
> Expanding the concepts of [[marginal cost]] and [[marginal benefit]], we get *Marginal Social Cost/Benefit ($\text{MSC/MSB}$)* and *Marginal Private Cost/Benefit ($\text{MPC/MPB}$)* 
> 
> When $\text{MSC}=\text{MPC}$ and $\text{MSB}=\text{MPB}$, a good's production is considered to produce no [[Externalities]]. In such a case the [[market equilibrium]] is the socially optimal, [[Allocative Efficiency|allocatively efficient]] level of output (no *market failure* is present)
