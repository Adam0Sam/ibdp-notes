Taxes can be [[#Proportional]], [[#Regressive]] or [[#Progressive]], with each methods placing different burdens on the rich and the poor, thus defining the extent of [[inequality]]

### Proportional
A proportional tax is a tax for which the percentage remains constant as income increases. The rich will pay more tax than the poor in absolute terms, but the burden of the tax will be no greater on the rich than it is on the poor.

### Regressive

A tax that decreases in percentage as income increases is said to be regressive. Such a tax places exacerbates [[inequality]].

While it may seem counterintuitive, most national governments use functionally regressive taxes, for example, [[Government Taxes|indirect taxes]] such as VAT (value added), GST (goods and services) and sales tax as they proportionally make up a larger part of poorer households.

Additionally, at higher incomes the marginal propensity to consume becomes less and more income goes to savings/investment

### Progressive

This is a tax for which the percentage paid in tax increases as income increases. Most nations' income tax systems are progressive (for example, tax brackets)
