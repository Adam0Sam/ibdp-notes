Mainly two types of taxes can be identified: **direct** and **indirect** taxes

**Direct** taxes are levied directly on individuals or companies, via income taxes, capital taxes, etc

**Indirect** taxes differ in that they are only collected from suppliers *after* they've collected revenue from consumers (*e.g. sales tax*)

(p.s. there are also different [[Tax Systems]])

> [!Error] An argument against indirect taxes
> They are *regressive*, in the sense that consumption taxes place a larger burden on lower income households, thus exacerbating inequality
