A price ceiling is a maximum price imposed by the [[Government Intervention|government]] below the [[Market Equilibrium|equilibrium price]] in a market. Such a state of affairs develops when the government determines that there is potential for higher than desired prices

As seen, a *binding* price ceiling (*one that is actually below the equilibrium price*) [[Price Signals|signals]] to consumers to demand more of a specified good and to producers to produce less of that same good. This skewed perception of the market results in a **shortage** and a *decreased* market size. 

The supposed benefit is increased [[Consumer Surplus|consumer surplus]], although that comes with fewer *overall* consumers

> [!Tip] Rationing
> With price as a rationing device gone, different methods are assumed, whether that is ration cards/vouchers, increased waiting times, barter deals, etc. In such a sense, price controls may create winners (consumers who get the good at the controlled price) and losers (consumers who lose access to the good)

> The disequilibrium created by a price ceiling puts pressure on sellers to withhold their output from the formal market and instead sell it on the informal or **[[Black Market|black]]** market
