Whereas [[Price Ceiling|price ceilings]] are set below the [[Market Equilibrium|equilibrium price]], a price floor is set *above* the equilibrium price, thus achieving the opposite effect than that of price ceilings: [[producer surplus]] increases, while [[consumer surplus]] decreases  

This is usually intended to help the producers of essential commodities (*like food crops*) earn an income that allows them to continue their production even while equilibrium prices fall.


> [!Warning] Negative effects
> Similarly as with [[price ceiling|price ceilings]], price floors result in [[Excess Supply]] and a reduced market size (*because less is demanded at the higher price*) 
> ![[Pasted image 20240221152711.png]]
> In the case that the government does *not* buy up excess production, it will end up on the [[black market]]

> [!Example] Real-life examples
> 1. Minimum wage is a price floor present in basically all economies. 
> 2. Coffee market in Brazil: coffee is a key agricultural export and a source of income for thousands of farmers, thus the government has set a price floor of $\text{R\$}360$ for 60$\text{kg}$ of coffee. In the case that the floor becomes *binding*, the government buys up all excess production at that price

> [!Tip] Discourse regarding minimum wage
> Some argue that overall demand is increased by a minimum wage. Because the higher wage earners spend their additional money into the circular flow (often on goods like food, rent, and consumer goods), overall demand increases. This increased demand offsets the increased wage job losses or may even create more employment opportunities in those industries.
