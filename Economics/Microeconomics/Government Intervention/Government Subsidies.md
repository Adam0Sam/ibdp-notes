> - Support a vital industry, critical for economic security (*e.g. [[Price Floor|coffee beans in Brazil]]*)
> - To address a *balance of payments* deficit by increasing export revenue and thus making local products more competitive on the global market (*e.g. EV's in China*)

> [[Consumer surplus]], at the lower price of $P_{E1}$ increases by $\text{efg}$, so does [[producer surplus]] at the higher price of $P_{2}$ by $\text{bc}$. The total subsidy however, covers $(P_2-P_{E1})\cdot Q_{E1}$ and thus results in deadweight loss at $\text{d}$
