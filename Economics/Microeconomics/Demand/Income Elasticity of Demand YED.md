$$\text{YED} = \frac{\%\Delta Q_d}{\%\Delta Y}$$

People tend to increase their spending when their income improves. 

But whether an increase in income actually increases demand for any particular good depends on whose income rises, and on their relationship to that good.

#### Normal Goods
Goods whose price increases as income increases. As mentioned above, it's relative (*with increased income, bikes may become a normal good for poorer populations but not richer ones*)

#### Inferior goods
These are goods for which demand decreases as income rises.

Inferior goods are generally considered to be a *cheaper* substitute to higher quality goods.
