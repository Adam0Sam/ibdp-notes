#### Proportion of Income Spent on The Good
Demand for goods that make up a large proportion of a consumerâ€™s income *tends to be more elastic* since a particular percentage change in price will appear much larger to a consumer than the same percentage change in price
of a good that makes up a very small proportion of income.

#### Degree of Necessity
##### Addictiveness
Addictive goods such as alcohol, tobacco, drugs, and fatty or salty foods, tend to have relatively inelastic demand. 

The reason is obvious: consumers with a physical dependence on a good will be unwilling or unable to respond greatly to price increases.

##### Necessity or Luxury
Goods that are necessary to consumers will have less elastic demand than the luxuries we can do without if the price rises.

#### Time
The amount of time consumers have to respond to a price change determines the PED.

Immediately following a change in price, it is unlikely consumers will adjust their consumption by much. In the long run it is more likely that Demand will be more price elastic

---

Generally speaking, at higher prices, demand tends to be *relatively elastic* for most goods. 
But as the price falls and the quantity demanded increases, the percentage changes in price become larger and the percentage changes in quantity become smaller, causing the PED to decrease at lower prices and higher quantities.

This is true because:
- Higher prices make up a larger part of consumers' income
- Mathematically, at the upper left range reflect higher incremental percentage price changes and lower incremental percentage quantity changes (*opposite is true in the lower right range*)
