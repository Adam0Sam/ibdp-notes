> As the price of a good decreases, the **real income** of consumers increases and thus some, if they chose so, are able to buy more of a good

> **The Substitution Effect**
> When the price of a product falls the product in question becomes more desirable (*its utility/price ratio will have improved relative*) relative to other products of the same kind. 

> **The Law Of Diminishing Marginal Utility**
> As we consume additional units of a product or service, the satisfaction (*utility*) we derive for each unit (*marginal unit*) gets smaller (*diminishes*)
