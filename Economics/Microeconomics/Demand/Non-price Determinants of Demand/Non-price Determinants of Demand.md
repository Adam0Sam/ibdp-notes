These are all the other the other variables, held constant when using the [[Ceteris Paribus|ceteris paribus assumption]] in the making of Price-Demand curves

A change in the price itself will cause movement along the curve, while the change in one of these determinants will cause the entire curve to shift

The **Non-price Determinants of Demand** fall into 5 categories
- [[Income Elasticity of Demand YED|Income]]
- Tastes and Preferences
- Future Price Expectations
- Price of Related goods (*substitutes and complements*)
- [[Number of Consumers]]

### An increase
in demand will increase the scarcity of the good, and cause a [[Excess Demand|temporary shortage]].

That shortage will cause the price to be bid higher and higher, to a point where quantity demanded and supplied meet.

## A decrease
in demand will decrease the scarcity of the good, and cause a [[Excess Supply|temporary surplus]].
