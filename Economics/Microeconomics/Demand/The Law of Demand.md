The law of [[Demand|demand]] states that as the price of a good *increases*, the quantity demanded of the good *decreases*. 

The opposite is also expected to hold as true: as the price of a good *decreases*, the quantity demanded of that good *increases*.

This concept rises to the level of a *law* in economics because it conforms closely to [[factors that underlie the Law of Demand|everyday reality]].
