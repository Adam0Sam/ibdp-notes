There are several determinants of supply, a change in any of which would cause a market supply curve to shift:
- Changes in Costs of Factors of Production
- [[Prices of Related Goods]]
- Indirect [[Government Taxes|Taxes]] and Subsidies
- Future Prices Expectations
- Changes in Technology
- Number of Firms
- Shocks (*natural disasters, economic*)

There is some overlap with [[Non-price Determinants of Demand]], only Changes in *Costs of Factors of Production, Indirect Taxes and Subsidies, Changes in Technology* are unique
