## Time
An important determinant of how responsive producers are to price changes is the amount of time following a change in price over which producers are able to adjust their output.

$S_1$ - the [[market period]] (immediately following a change in price)
$S_2$ - [[short-run|the short-run]]
$S_3$ - [[long-run|the long-run]]

## Mobility of Factors of Production
The lower tech and more simple a good’s production process, the more elastic supply tends to be, while higher tech, more capital-intensive goods typically display a more inelastic supply. (*heavy industries, highly skilled services and primary commodities are inelastic because a lot of capital is required for the extension or reduction of production*)

## Unused Capacity
Excess capacity refers to the amount a firm is able to produce in the short run without having to expand its plant size and the amount of capital and land employed in production.

If an industry is operating at a level of output at which it has large amounts of unused capacity, then producers are able to quickly and easily respond to changes in the good’s price. 

If, however, an industry is operating at or near full capacity, supply  will be highly inelastic in the short run.

## Ability to Store Stocks
If large inventories of a good can easily be stored in warehouses or kept on hand by producers, then supply of the good can be highly responsive to changes in the price. (video games, software, low-tech manufactured goods, and certain non-perishable commodities)
