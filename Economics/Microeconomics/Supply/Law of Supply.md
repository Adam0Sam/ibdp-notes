There is a direct relationship between a good's price and the quantity supplied, this is because of the factors that underlie the Law of Supply:
- [[Law of diminishing marginal returns]]
- [[Marginal cost]]


The law of supply dictates that any change in the market price will lead individual firms to change their level of output based on the cost of producing the good, thereby causing the market quantity supplied to increase or decrease depending on how the price changed.
