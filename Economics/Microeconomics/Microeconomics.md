**The study of [[Economic systems|specific markets]]**, such as the market for goods and services, as well as the market for labour.

It examines the motivations and general rules of behaviour guiding buyers and sellers in these markets, and includes the concepts of **[[supply]], [[demand]], and [[Market Equilibrium|equilibrium]] prices**.

While microeconomics **assumes a [[The Free Market|free market system]]** that uses prices to help allocate resources, it also attempts to account for **[[Market Failure|failure]]** of the [[The Free Market|free market]], where [[Government Intervention|government corrections]] are required.
