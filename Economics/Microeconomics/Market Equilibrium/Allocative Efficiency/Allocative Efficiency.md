**allocative efficiency** is generally considered to be in effect if society is getting the goods and services it wants most in the right amount

Thus it is achieved when the *[[Demand|marginal benefit]]* is equal to the [[Marginal cost]]

[[Three Basic Economic Questions|One of the basic questions of economics]] is *what to produce* and allocative efficiency answers that (*maybe*)

The benefit of achieving equilibrium is that the **social/community surplus** (*in other words, [[Consumer Surplus]] + [[Producer Surplus]]*) is at its highest magnitude

> [!Tip] When allocative efficiency is not achieved, the loss of *community surplus* is designated as a **welfare/deadweight loss** (DWL)
