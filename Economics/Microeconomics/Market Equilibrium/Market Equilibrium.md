When [[demand]] and [[supply]] are combined, there is a tendency for the market to reach a **market equilibrium**, a point where the quantity of a product demanded is equal to the quantity of a product supplied.

This creates a *market-clearing (equilibrium)* *price* and *quantity*, where there is no [[Excess Demand]] or [[Excess Supply]]

#### Market Disequilibrium
Is the exact opposite. It occurs when there *is* excess supply or demand

As elsewhere, in the analysis of a market's equilibrium, [[Ceteris Paribus]] is in effect
