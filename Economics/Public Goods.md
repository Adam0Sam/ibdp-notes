Similarly defined to [[Common Pool Resources]] and opposite to [[Private Goods]], *Public Goods* are goods which are **non-excludable** and **non-rivalrous**

Public goods are defined by their inherent inability to exclude certain people from deriving utility from them. This is why Pure Public Goods would not be available without [[Direct Government Provision]]. (*sometimes governments employ contractors, for example, construction firms*)

> [!Example] Examples
> - National Defense 
> - Roads, Sidewalks and other infrastructure
> - Lighthouses
> - Fire, Police Departments
> - Legal, Criminal Justice system

We can informally consider the [[Market Failure]] of public goods to be the *ultimate* market failure, since these goods won't be *under/overproduced* but rather simply *not* produced. (see: [[Common Pool Resources|free-rider problem]])
