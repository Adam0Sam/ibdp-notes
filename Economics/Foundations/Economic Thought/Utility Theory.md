[[Microeconomics]] as a field of study emerged only in the 19th century with the development of **utility theory**, which was used to explain the behaviour of individuals who are able to consistently rank their choices in order of their personal preferences.

**Utility** in economics is the *happiness* or *satisfaction* derived from any particular good, service, or activity that an individual could choose to consume or pursue.

**Utility theory** formed the conceptual foundation of what would later emerge as the market [[Models|demand and supply models]]
