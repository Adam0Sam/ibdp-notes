A set of theories introduces by [[John Maynard Keynes]], that advocated for [[Government Intervention|interventionism]].

After the Great Depression it had become apparent that the [[laissez-faire]] approach to economics in times of crisis was ineffective as slumping economies would get stuck in a [[liquidity trap]] 

[[John Maynard Keynes|Keynes]] developed modern [[Macroeconomics]] theory through his *[[Keynes' General Theory|general theory]]*, which viewed a nation's economy as a *giant machine that could be controlled through various levers*.

Keynes's work did not deny the [[Classical Economics|classical view]] that economies would, in time, self-correct but changed the idea that economists can sit idly in times of economic downturn

Keynesian economics found a middle ground between [[Classical Economics]] and [[Socialism]]
