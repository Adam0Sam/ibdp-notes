**[[Supply]] creates its own [[Demand]]**

> [!Quote] From [[Jean-Baptiste Say]]
 *... a product is no sooner created than it, from that instant, affords a market for other products to the full extent of its own value*

>[!Example] 
>The act of paying workers in one factory creates demand for the products from another factory equal to the value of the labour provided in Factory A.

*[[Macroeconomics|Macroeconomic]] shocks* like recessions, stagnation, and involuntary unemployment, according to Say’s Law, are resolved automatically by the free market’s rebalancing
between the amount produced and consumed.
