The faith in the [[Classical Economics|morality of free markets]] and the socially beneficial outcomes of the pursuit of individual self-interest was called into question by several philosopher's in the *19th century*, most notably [[Karl Marx]].

Socialists stated that, under the market system, *human labour had become a disposable commodity*. Workers (*the proletariat*) were paralleled to slaves with capitalists as their master

Capitalists exploited *the workers* by paying them less than their work was worth in the market and, in turn, profiting the difference.
