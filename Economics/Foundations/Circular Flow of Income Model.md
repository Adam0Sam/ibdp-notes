> [!Tip] Inputs turn into outputs, income turns into revenue.

Buyers and sellers are interdependent. A drop in one sector affects the others. Reduced incomes in the resource market will reduce spending in the product market.

> [!Warning] The former model is very unrealistic
> It assumes a **closed market**, without leakages (in the forms of *taxes, savings, imports*) and injections (*government spending, loans, exports*)
