**Positive economics** deals with what is. It focuses on observations and expressions
based purely on factual evidence. 

Such observations are generally held as being irrefutable.

> [!Example] Examples of Positive economics
> - [[The Law of Demand]]

When making claims based on logic and empirical evidence often times the [[Ceteris Paribus]] assumption is made.

Economists have formalised [[Supply]], [[Demand]], and many other principles in [[Models]]
that can be used to predict and explain how society functions.

*There is no role for values or ethics in the realm of positive economics.*
