The free market economy is a system of resource allocation dependent on the private ownership of [[Factors of Production]] and on the free exchange of goods and services in a price system.

\Free markets, in their purest form, exclude any [[Government Intervention|government action]] and in fact allow for no functioning government at all.

In the modern world a capitalist free market system exists based on the initiative of [[Factors of Production|entrepeneurs]], seeking profit margins

A free market should, in theory, reach a state of [[Market Equilibrium|equilibrium]] where *full employment and use of resources is achieved* is achieved
