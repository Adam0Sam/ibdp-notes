The **PPC** demonstrates the basic concepts of *choice, [[Economic Scarcity|scarcity]] and the [[opportunity cost]]*

> [!Example] The model makes two main assumptions
> - The [[factors of production]] and level of technology is static
> - An economy produces only two goods

[^1]: The graph demonstrates a Constant-cost PPC as the goods (hours) are similar in their production


> [!Tip] What the PPC tells us
> - any point on the PPC line represents the full use of all resources and technology, and is therefore economically efficient
> - points inside the curve are levels of output that are inefficient, not using all resources available
> - points outside the curve are impossible unless conditions change


**[[The Law of Increasing Opportunity Cost]]** explains why the PPC is bowed outwards from the origin. 

Convex shaped PPC [^2]

[^2]: The PPC has a convex shape because of varied available resources and varied efficiency in utilizing them
