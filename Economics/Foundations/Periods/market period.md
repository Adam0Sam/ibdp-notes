The period immediately following a change in price is known as the **market period**, and during this time [[Price Elasticity of Supply|supply is highly inelastic]]. 

In the market period, producers do not have the time to adjust their output to changes in price. 


> [!Example] Corn
> Corn producers can release the little inventory they have and can perhaps harvest their crop earlier than planned, but the amount of land, labour and capital allocated to growing corn is fixed in the market period.

Quantity can increase minimally due to the fixed factors of production and limited inventory on hand.
