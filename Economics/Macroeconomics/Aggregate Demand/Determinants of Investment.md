Investment is defined as the addition of capital stock to the economy.

### Business Confidence
Again, just as household spending is influenced by consumer confidence, investment spending is subject to changes in the level of business confidence. (The OECD even tracks a business confidence index)

### Interest Rates
Again, just as with household consumption, business spending is *interest sensitive*

### Technology
The availability of new technologies are assumed to be followed by bouts of increased investment. 

### Business Taxes
A cut in business taxes will increase business profits and incentivize new spending on capital goods. The expected return on any potential investment also increases with reduced taxes

### Level of corporate indebtedness
Same store as with the level of household indebtedness
