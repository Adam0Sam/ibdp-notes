While [[Demand]] represents the amount of a particular good that consumers are willing to buy at a range of prices in a period of time, AD is the *total output* of a nations economy that *households*, *businesses*, *the government* and *foreigners* are willing to buy in a period of time at a range of *price levels* 

By the definition, it is clear to see that the scalar value of AD = [[National Income|GDP]], that is why the components of AD are the same as the components used in calculating the GDP (consumption, investment, government spending, net exports)
