### Consumer Confidence
The degree of optimism that consumers feel about the overall state of the economy.

### Interest Rates
At higher interest rates, there is a greater [[Opportunity Cost]] to spending money *today*, while at lower interest rates the opportunity cost is lower since future income is foregone by spending money now.

### [[Wealth]]
Here, wealth is used to express the value of a household's assets

For some reason, humans tend to hold the value of their asset value as a reference point for deciding the lavishness of their lifestyle.

### Income Taxes
When income taxes are reduced, households are left with more disposable income. (This is not to say that lower income taxes = higher [[GDP]], as government income increases)

### Level of household indebtedness
Same as with [[#Wealth]], liabilities decrease the perceived monetary value an individual holds. Interest payments on accrued debts also decrease a household's income

Of course, in the [[short-run]], debt allows a household to increase its consumption

### Expectations of future price levels (expected [[Inflation|inflation rate]])
Basically the same as [[Non-price Determinants of Demand|future price expectations]] in individual markets.
