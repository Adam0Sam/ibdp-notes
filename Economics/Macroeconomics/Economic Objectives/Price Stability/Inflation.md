Inflation is defined as an increase in the *average* price level of goods and services in an economy over time (or, alternatively, the decrease in the value of money over time)

Inflation essentially reduces the [[GDP per capita using PPP|purchasing power]] of money, thus encouraging households and firms to spend now rather than postpone spending (similar to how low [[Determinants of Consumption#Interest Rates|interest rates]] encourage spending)


> [!Tip] Demand-Pull vs Cost-Push
>> Demand-pull inflation is caused when one of the [[Determinants of Consumption|components of GDP]] increase. (It must be noted that, according to the [[Long Run Aggregate Supply|Keynesian model of AD]], Demand-Pull inflation only occurs when a nation is producing at or is close to full-employment)

> Businesses typically enjoy greater consumer price inflation as it alludes to higher profits. Consumer on the other hand suffer

> Inflation also benefits individuals or country's with lots of debt when the owed interest rate is fixed or rises more slowly than the [[Rate of Inflation|inflation rate]]. Money borrowed becomes worth more than money paid

Unchecked *high [[inflation]]* significantly increases spending which worsens the scarcity of resources, which increases inflation, resulting in a positive feedback loop which can destroy economic value. This is called an inflationary spiral
