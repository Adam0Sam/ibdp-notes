The **CPI** measures the change in income a consumer would need in order to maintain the same standard of living over time under a new set of prices as under the original set of prices

> [!warning] Limitations of CPI
As with everything in economics, there are limitations with CPI
> ###### Effect based on household income level
> Poorer consumers tend to spend a greater percentage of their income on goods and services, whereas richer consumers tend to save/invest more.
> ###### Changing consumption patterns
> CPI (obv) does not reflect the change in consumption patterns but it is also slow to adapt to changes as CPI metrics are not updated frequently (once a decade or so)
> ###### Improvements in product quality not captured
> ###### Volatility of energy and food prices
> D&S tends to be [[Price Elasticity of Demand|inelastic]] for food and energy, which often make up a significant portion of CPI. Though, in order to provide a picture for how *most* goods/services change in price, economists measure **core CPI** (without food and energy)
> ###### Irrelevant to Producers
> Though obvious, CPI measures price changes in consumer products. a metric such as **[[Producer Price Index (PPI)]]**
