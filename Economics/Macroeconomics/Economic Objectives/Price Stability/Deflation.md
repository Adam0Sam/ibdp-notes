Deflation is a sustained decrease in the average price of a nation's output over time (the other side of [[Consumer Price Index (CPI)|CPI]])

Diametrically opposed to [[inflation]], deflation is either caused by a negative shock to [[Aggregate Demand|AD]] or a positive shock to [[Short Run Aggregate Supply|SRAS]], the latter of which might be considered as desirable its accompanied by a decrease in costs and (temporary) increase in [[employment]]. 

In most cases however, both movements of AD and SRAS will likely first result in disinflation rather than deflation (as most countries try to keep a positive inflation rate)

> [!warning] The Costs of Deflation
> Similarly to [[inflation]] deflation results in uncertainty in prices and deferring consumption (why buy now when it might be cheaper later?).

> It also possesses as similar redistributive effect. The real burden of a debt increases when prices fall. Deflation increases the real cost of borrowing.
