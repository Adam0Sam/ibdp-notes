The notion that wages tend to hold steady during a recession originated with the [[Keynesianism|Keynesian]] explanation of the Great Depression of the 1930s, and has several rationales:

1. Firms choose to fire some workers and retain the rest at full wages to avoid the morale reducing effect of lower wages 
2. Unemployment benefits may reduce the need for workers to automatically take any lower-paying job after a layoff
3. Unions can negotiate wages that are higher than average and may also lock firms into those wages for several years at a time, regardless of a sudden recession
