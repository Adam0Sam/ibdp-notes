[[#Types of Unemployment|The various causes of unemployment]] result in major social disruption. While some forms of unemployment my be accepted as normal, rising unemployment levels can threaten the interdependence of the economy's [[Circular Flow of Income Model|circular flow]]. Such events inspire governments to stage forms of [[Government Intervention|intervention]]. 

> [!info] What is unemployment
> In an economic sense a person must ‘*be out of work and willing to accept a suitable job or start an enterprise if the opportunity arises, and actively looking for ways to obtain a job or start an enterprise*’.
> $$
\text{unempoyment rate (\%)} = \frac{\text{number of unemployed}}{\text{labour force}}\cdot 100
>$$

> [!tip] Labour Force
> Persons who are neither employed nor seeking employment are not in the labour force; this includes retired persons, full-time students, those taking care of children or other family members, and others who are neither working nor seeking work.

> [!example] Difficulties in measuring unemployment
> 1. Methods of data collection (unemployment claims vs household surveys)
> 2. Disparities by group (regional (e.g. Turkey), ethnic/racial, gender)
> 3. '*hidden unemployment*': 
> 	- workers leaving the labour force (is this really 'hidden'?)
> 	- Part-time workers are technically employed
> 	- Quality of employment
> 	- Underemployment (i.e. highly skilled workers working low-skill jobs)

> [!Info] The labour market
> A labour market (essentially a subset of the resource/factor market in the [[Circular Flow of Income Model|circular flow model]]) is where households and firms meet to buy and sell labour.
> 
> The demand for labour (DL) and supply of labour (SL) curves are essentially identical to those from [[Microeconomics]]
