Workers who do seasonal labour (golf courses, migrant farmers, ski-lift operators, summer-camp instructors) may be unemployed between seasons and suffer **seasonal** unemployment. 

Seasonal unemployment, like [[frictional unemployment]] is also considered voluntary as many such workers choose their jobs for the freedom and other benefits such employment offers (*really bro?*)
