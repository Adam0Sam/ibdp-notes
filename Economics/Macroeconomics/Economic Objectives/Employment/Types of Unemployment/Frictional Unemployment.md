Workers who are in between jobs or just entering the labour force for the first time are referred to as **frictionally** unemployed. 

This includes:
- Relocating to a new area
- Leaving a job in attempt to find a better one
- Looking for a job right after graduation

As such, frictional unemployment is generally short term ($\le$ 3 months) and is often voluntary

> Frictional unemployment tends to decrease during economic recessions and increase during economic expansions (duh)
