*also called demand-deficient unemployment, since workers lose their jobs due to weak demand*

Workers whose skills are in demand given the structure of the nationâ€™s economy but who lose their jobs because of a fall in [[aggregate demand]] are **cyclically** unemployed.

Cyclical unemployment arises due to fluctuations in a nation's [[Macroeconomics|business cycle]] and the short-run stickiness of wages illustrated by the upward sloping [[Short Run Aggregate Supply|SRAS curve]] 

> [!example] Cyclical Unemployment in AD/AS
 Cyclical unemployment is shown in an [[aggregate demand]] (AD)/[[aggregate supply]] (AS) model as the gap between equilibrium national output and full employment national output when a deflationary gap exists following a decrease in AD.

 Because of [[downward wage stickiness]], at least in the [[short-run]], the equilibrium holds for some time, creating a surplus of workers in the economy, known, again, as **cyclical unemployment**

> Of course, [[long-run]] as high cyclical unemployment puts downward pressure on wages, wages adjust

> Ceteris paribus, if a country's [[Employment|unemployment rate]] exceeds the [[The Natural Rate of Unemployment|NRU]], some cyclical unemployment is occurring and will require an expansionary response
