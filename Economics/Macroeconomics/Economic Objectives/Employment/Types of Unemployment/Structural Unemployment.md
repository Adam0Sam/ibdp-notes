Structural unemployment is a form of involuntary unemployment among workers whose skills are no longer in demand.

Structural unemployment arises when demand for a certain typeof labour decreases, as opposed to demand for all labour decreasing (as in the case of [[cyclical unemployment]]). This may be due to automation, outsourcing or a country's shift from the primary to secondary and tertiary sectors
