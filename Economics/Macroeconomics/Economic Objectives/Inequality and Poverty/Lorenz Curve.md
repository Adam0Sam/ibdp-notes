The **Lorenz curve** is a graphical representation of a country’s income distribution. It plots the cumulative percentage of the nation’s income across the cumulative percentage of the population

> [!info] The Gini Coefficient
> Simply put, it is the ratio of the area between the *line of equality* and the lorenz curve and the total area under the *line of equality* of a respective nation

> A **Gini Index** is $\text{coefficient}\cdot 100$, where an index of *100%* expresses perfect inequality of income (where the 1% earns 100%) and an index of *0%* expresses perfect equality of income
