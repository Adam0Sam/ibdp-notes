Absolute poverty is measured in terms of the basic need for survival. It is the amount of income a person needs to have in order to stay alive.

> [!example] Poverty Lines
> The World Bankâ€™s international poverty line in 2020 was valued at $1.90 per day in international dollars in terms of 2011 [[GDP per capita using PPP|purchasing power parity]], which equalises its purchasing power across all countries and currencies.
> 
> Since it's measured income at PPP, the poverty line should expectedly be higher in higher income countries and lower in lower income countries
