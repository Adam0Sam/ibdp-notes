The consequences of [[Inequality]] and [[Poverty]] are numerous

### Less Economic Growth

One may argue that in unequal societies, the increased profits and savings of the rich contribute to higher levels of investment and innovation. Conversely, if inequality reduces the incomes of the poor and squeezes out middle class earners, their lack of spending is reflected in decreased [[GDP]]. 

Furthermore, reduced economic opportunity reduces the level of education attainment thus halting the possibility of an increase in [[Long Run Aggregate Supply|LRAS]]

### Less Social Stability and Social Cohesion

Unequal societies have lower rates of civic participation, lower voter turnout, and appear to have fewer acts of altruism. This contributes to the comparative political power of the wealthier groups (maybe even further exacerbating [[inequality]])

Moreover, research finds a link between physical and psychological health and inequality
