Relative poverty is a comparative measure of [[poverty]]. A person is said to be relatively poor if they do not reach some specified level of income, for example, 50% of average earnings for the country

If the average income of a nation rises and the income distribution remains the same, the level of relative poverty will stay the same, while the number of people in [[absolute poverty]] will decrease.

> [!example] How is relative poverty measured?
> ### Median income benchmarks
> The OECD defines relative poverty as the percentage of people living with less than 50% of median equivalized disposable income, though this may vary by country and methodology (for example, income after or before taxes)
> 
> ### Minimum income standards
> ... also referred to as a 'living wage', the standard is the amount of income one needs to *fully* participate in society
> 
> ### Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)
> The MPI is a composite indicator, which is calculated by identifying the different aspects of poverty and assigning each factor a relative weight based on the likely impact each dimension will have on the experience of poverty.
> 
> MPI estimates that 1.3 billion people are *multidimensionally* poor.

> [!warning] Difficulties in Measuring Poverty
> - Household surveys are subject to sampling and weighing issues
> - Definitions of poverty may vary
> - Non-income aspects of poverty are difficult to measure and are context-specific (for example, nutrition levels)
> - Conflict Zones/Government Corruption

> ### [[Inequality]] of Opportunity
> Poor households may be locked into a **poverty trap** that prevents them from improving their standards of living. The World Bank estimates suggest that income inequality highly correlates with upward mobility. Relatedly, there are significant differences in the ownership of resources/capital.
> 
> ### Globalisation
> Firms may hop between countries seeking the lowest labour costs. At the same time, international companies require more middle management, further increasing [[inequality]] between low-skilled labourers and managers
