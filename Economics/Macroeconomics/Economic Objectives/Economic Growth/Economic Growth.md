Economic growth is defined as the growth of the real value of output in an economy over time, usually measured as growth in real [[GDP]]. 

The growth rate, $GR$, measures the speed at which GDP grows. Important to note that a decreased growth rate does *not* indicate a recession.

> [!warning] Sources of Potential Conflict Between Economic Growth and Other [[Macroeconomics|Macroeconomic]] objectives
> ### Conflict with [[Price Stability|Low Inflation]]
> The relationship between full employment and inflation is often a negative one. Increases of AD, while likely to increase growth (corresponding to higher [[employment]]) also increase [[inflation]] (raising prices)
> ### Conflict with [[Sustainability]]
> The effects of growth on sustainability depend entirely on the composition of output and the manner in which it was made. Some types of production have associated negative [[externalities]]
> ### Conflict with [[Poverty|Equality]]
> Growth may not be distributed evenly, and the gains from growth may be rather tightly concentrated among the wealthy, though this may be combated with a progressive tax system.
