Monetary policy refers to actions taken by a country's [[Central Bank|central bank]] that increase or decrease the supply of money in order to change interest rates and either expand or contract the amount of aggregate spending

Monetary policy is primarily a *demand-side* policy, one which aims to impact [[Aggregate Demand|AD]] by changing the interest rate, a determinant of both [[Determinants of Consumption|consumption]] and [[Determinants of Investment|investment]]

The changing of interest rates may also affect a currency's exchange rate, thus by extension trade/net exports, another component of [[Aggregate Demand|AD]].
