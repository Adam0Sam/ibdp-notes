A central bank is the institution that regulates all commercial banks and loans to those banks. Additionally, commercial banks' reserves (the share of total deposits not lent out) are held by the central bank. (CB=Bank of Banks)

CBs also oversee the process of money creation. The CB determines the *minimum reserve requirement*, the multiple by which the amount of money in an economy can exceed the size of the *monetary base* (the amount of actual cash/coins + banks' reserves).
