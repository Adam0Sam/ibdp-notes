Macroeconomics centers on national economies as a whole, with a focus on the overall **performance of an economy**. 

The scope of the subject changes from the individual markets of [[microeconomics]] to the broader measures of total well-being.

In seeking to improve the general livelihood of their citizens, governments tend to prioritize four macroeconomic concerns/objectives:
1. [[Employment]] (low unemployment rate)
2. [[Economic Growth]] (increasing [[National Income]])
3. [[Price Stability]] (low [[inflation]]/[[deflation]] rate)
4. [[Inequality]] and [[Poverty]] (equitable distribution of income)


A major focus of this branch of economics is understanding the role governments play in the management of the national economy using the **tools of [[Fiscal Policy|fiscal]] and [[Monetary Policy|monetary]] policy**.

Similar to [[Demand]] and [[Supply]] in [[Microeconomics]], similar concepts exist in the field of macroeconomics in the form of [[Aggregate Demand]]  and [[Aggregate Supply]]. While regular D&S focuses on individual markets, AD&AS adapt to entire nations' economies
