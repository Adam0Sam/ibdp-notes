The short run aggregate supply curve (SRAS) describes the relationship between the price level and the quantity of goods and services supplied in an economy during the [[short-run]], a period of time during which wages and other input prices are fixed

> [!tip] Sticky Wages
> During the short-run, wages will remain at least relatively inflexible due to several factors, like *labour contracts, minimum wage laws, unemployment benefits*, and the **power of labour unions**.
> 
> Owing to the aforementioned factors, firms are unable to raise/lower wages quickly in response to macroeconomic shocks and are thus forced to layoff or hire workers
> 
> In essence, SRAS is upward sloping mainly due to the stickiness of wages as there is a direct relationship between the price level and the level of output/[[Employment|employment]]

> [!info] Determinants of SRAS
> - Wage rates
> - Resource/Energy/Transportation costs
> - [[Government Intervention]], both in the form of regulations/price controls and subsidies
> - Exchange rates (in the sense that imported materials are less expensive when a currency is strong)
