According to classical economic theory, wages and prices are fully flexible in the [[long-run]], and therefore there is no trade-off between inflation and unemployment. 

In the Keynesian view, however, recognizes that as an economy approached its full employment level, the limited degree of spare capacity for increased production would drive wages and other resources upwards, limiting potential output at a certain level

> Even as things like unemployment insurance, minimum, wage laws, labour unions, and contracts contribute to sticky wages, over time, following a change in AD, wages will become flexible, and either fall or rise

> For example, in the case of rising price levels, firms would face higher wages and thus would not be willing/able to increase output. While nominal wages would increase, real wages would remain constant (same story with falling price levels)

> The LRAS is vertical at a country's full employment level of output (or the [[GDP]] that would be produced when all resources are fully utilized and wages have fully adjusted to the price levels)

> The curve is horizontal at output levels where there is ample spare capacity and vertical at output levels where there is virtually no spare capacity.

> Any attempt to increase output beyond full employment will only result in [[Inflation]]

> The Keynesian view acknowledges that wages are **[[Downward Wage Stickiness|downwardly inflexible]]**, which explains the horizontal range.

> Beyond full employment, however, wages are highly flexible, which prevents an economy from producing beyond its $Y_{fe}$
