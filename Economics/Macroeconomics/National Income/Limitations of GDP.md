> [!Warning] Limitations of national income statistics
> GDP only partly represents our view of a country's true welfare because
> - GDP does not include increasing life spans
> - GDP does not account for [[black market]] and parallel market ( #todo what is a parallel market?) activity 
> - GDP does not account for unpaid output (e.g., households which rely on their own self-grown produce (subsistence economies) or the work of housewives)
> - GDP does not account for rising quality/falling prices due to technological innovations

> [!Warning] Overestimations of GDP
> - GDP overestimates the net benefit of negative [[externalities]]
> - GDP does not measure [[sustainability]]

GDP also does not adequately portray the composition of the output of an economy (*does the economy produce a large amount of demerit goods?*), the quality of life within that economy and the distribution of wealth

Because of these limitations, there exist other indices which seek to account for the aforementioned factors:
- Better Life Index
- Happiness Index
- Happy Planet Index

#todo make summaries of these indices
