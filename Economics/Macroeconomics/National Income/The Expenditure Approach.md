The expenditure approach counts [[National Income|GDP]] through the product market view in the [[Circular Flow of Income Model]]

The expenditure approach counts the total spending on [[Final Goods|final new goods]] and services in a given year. (With the assumption that for every transaction there is a buyer and a seller)

Spending is placed into four broad categories:
- Consumption ($C$)
- Investment ($I$)
- Government Spending ($G$)
- Net Exports ($X-M$)


With this
$$
\mathrm{GDP} = C + I+G+(X-M)
$$
