In measuring national income, it is importance to understand the equivalence of expenditure to income (as in the [[Circular Flow of Income Model]]). With this in mind, there are three main methods of counting national income:
1. [[The Expenditure Approach]]
2. [[The Income Approach]]
3. [[The Output Approach]]

$$
\mathrm{GDP}=\text{national output} = \text{national income} = \text{national spending}
$$

> [!Tip] GDP vs GNI
>  GDP defines its measurement of income *geographically*, regardless of the entity that owns the factor of production.
>  
>  [[GNI|GNI]] defines its measurement of income by *nationality of ownership*, regardless of where entities operate

>[!Example] Discrepancies between GDP and GNI
>Countries that have $\mathrm{GNI}>\mathrm{GDP}$ are likely to have workers or firms overseas who send income back to home country accounts
>
> Correspondingly, countries that have $\mathrm{GNI}<\mathrm{GDP}$, are likely to have significant foreign presence.

> [!Info] Nominal vs Real
> Nominal values measure output with reference to the current currency value while real values will adjust the measure for account inflation/deflation levels
