The income approach to national income accounting attempts to count [[National Income|GDP]] through the resource market view of the [[Circular Flow of Income Model]]

Similarly as in [[The Expenditure Approach]], the assumption is made that for every transaction there is a buyer and a seller 

The factor payments made for the [[Factors of Production]]:
- Wages ($W$)
- Interest ($I$)
- Rent ($R$)
- Profits ($P$)

Since a buyer's spending is recorded as revenue income on the income approach we get

$$
\begin{array}{}
W+I+R+P=C+I+G+(X-M)  \\ \\

\therefore W+I+R+P = \mathrm{GDP}
\end{array}
$$
