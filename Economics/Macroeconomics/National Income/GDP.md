> [!Warning] Critique of GDP/GNI
> GDP/GNI does not accurately measure *true* value output
> - Non-marketed output is not measured (things like subsistance farming, etc)
> - Illegal markets (black/shadow markets,etc)
> - Inability to account for the improvements of the goods/services themselves (consider improvements in technology, how do you quantify a better gpu, etc?)
> 	- Unaccounted externalities
> - Sustainability issues
> 
> GDP/GNI does not accurately reflect economic *well-being*
> - Composition (GDP growth does not reflect allocation. for example, military economies)
> - Education, life expectancy, etc
> - Distribution of Income
> - Undeserved poverty
