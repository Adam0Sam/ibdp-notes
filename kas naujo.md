1. thermal equilibrium of a planet means that it emits all it absorbs
2. current is direction invariant, meaning that the sum contribution of an electron flowing in one direction and a positive charge flowing into another is $2e$

1. resultant force from two component vectors must lie between $F_{1}+F_{1}$ and $|F_{1}-F_{2}|$
2. The uncertainty in the average time is typically estimated as **half the range** of the measurements: $\frac{\text{max measur} - \text{min measur.}}{2}$
3. average speed of a particle through one cycle is different from the wave speed. the particle speed denotes how fast a single particle oscillates between the min and max amplitudes where the wave speed denotes how fast a crest/through moves through a space. 
   
   the particle speed is not constant, its greatest at $x=0$ and lowest at the minima/maxima

1. The ideal gas law requires kelvin temperatures (instead of celsius, easy mistake to make)
