objects should be unique
you shouldn't describe them, but rather explain how they are related to the question
no introduction, no conclusion
the three separate objects should be complemented with three separate text.

do not use long introductions, just "Object 1 is..." not "For my first object I have chosen...". 

short text should be of two/three paragraphs: 
- intro: object and why I have chosen.
- then answer the question

indicate the source of the images of all three objects

also cite all instances of shared knowledge

refer to "knowledge and the knower" and "language/technology and knowledge"

also use knowledge framework and the 12 TOK concepts (that is the TOK aspect)

sample b is great?
