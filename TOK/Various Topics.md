> Rene Descarts famously renounced the ways of the scholastic (characterized by an emphasis on tradition on dogma and hailing from Aristotelian logic and early Christian thought) and instead proposed skepticism, the systematic and continuous process of doubting and testing).

> In *The Critique of Pure Reason*, Immanuel Kant argues we filter and shape our sensory experiences using prior categories of knowing and understanding. the mind plays an active role in forming the features of experience. In this context, achieving objectivity might be considered an ethical enterprise in which rules are applied fairly to all sides, and bias is eliminated. Therefore, objectivity involves a commitment - on behalf of the knower and their knowledge communities - to honesty and fairness.
