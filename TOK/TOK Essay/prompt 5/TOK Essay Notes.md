how is a model's validity defined? is a model only true if it represents the whole of reality perfectly? if that is the definition of choice, then sure, all models are wrong. at the same times, the validity of models is often defined by their applicability/utility in the real world, so if a model is useful is it really wrong? it's likely that the original Box quote intended to say that models have their limitations, a fact that I will try to outline in my essay

the test of utility is often hailed as the primary metric with which a model's validity can be determined. 

### Mathematics area of knowledge

1. The validity of models lies not in the models themselves but in how we use them. For the longest time, solutions to kepler's equation were obtained using numerical methods. but relatively recently, analytical solutions were introduced, suggesting that models may be usefulness in a wide range of scopes (in this case, $e$ and $M$ values) but may also be valid if the scope is reduced (for example, $e=1$?)
2. The validity of models is determined by the tools/methods available to evaluate predictions. essentially, the more powerful the tools used, the more correct a model is. i.e. the scope of the model's truth may be expanded, hypothetically extending to infinity. (**pro**: i.e. Keplers equation and values of convergence. **contra**: some example of a model which was assumed to be true but was disproven with better tools) (*mathematical model*) *maybe computational models like numerical weather prediction are more suited for this?*

### Psychology area of knowledge

1. A model is useful if it is simple. for example: maslows pyramid vs Jungian archetypes. both are highly critized yet 


### Philosophy of the social sciences

#### The absence of social laws 
Those who believe that adapting the aims and methods of natural science to social inquiry is both possible and desirable support the _unity of scientific method._ Such advocacy in this context is also referred to as _[naturalism](https://iep.utm.edu/naturali/)_.

Comte also advocated the unity of scientific method, arguing that the natural and social sciences should both adopt a positivist approach (where empiricism is the domininant/only source of truth)

*might be useful in relation to Pavlov's model*
In the middle third of the twentieth century an influential version of positivism, known as logical positivism, emphasized and refined the logical and linguistic implications of Comte’s empiricism, holding that meaningful statements about the world are limited to those that can be tested through direct observation.

Naturalism has been highly influential in the social sciences, especially since the middle in the twentieth century and particularly in the United States. Some critics point to what they view as formidable obstacles to subjecting the social world to scientific investigation. These include the possible absence of law-like regularities at the social level, the complexity of the social environment, and the difficulty of conducting controlled experiments.

For a regularity to be deemed a genuine [law of nature](https://iep.utm.edu/lawofnat/), the standard view holds that it must be universal; that is, it must apply in all times and places

The explanations discussed above for why social scientists have yet to identify genuine law-like regularities cite the practical difficulties of uncovering such laws in the social realm. But more radical critics of naturalism argue that the attempt to unify the methods of the natural and social sciences is deeply misguided. They claim that the social world is different from the natural world in crucial respects that render the methods of natural science at best inadequate for enhancing understanding of the social world. At worst, naturalism not only fundamentally mischaracterizes the social world, it also serves to reinforce oppressive beliefs, values and social practices. These critics include advocates of interpretive social inquiry, critical theorists, and postmodernists.


#### Duvergers's law?

Another proposed law of politics is Duverger’s Law, which posits that two-party systems will emerge in political systems that feature simple-majority, single-ballot electoral systems

Thus the laws of economics grounded in the assumption of instrumental rationality are in fact false. Outside of economics, the laws of social science are fewer and generally even more dubious.  Duverger’s law, which is also grounded in similar assumptions about human rationality, admits of numerous exceptions. Many simple-majority, single-ballot systems do in fact exhibit more than two political parties.

#### Meaningfulness of the Social World

Atoms, DNA, planets, and so forth, would still exist and be governed by natural laws if human beings did not exist. This is obviously not the case for the social world. Social institutions – a marketplace, a church, a business firm, a sports game, marriage, and so forth – are created and governed in part by the beliefs that people hold about them.

What implication does the meaningful nature of the social world have for the methods and aims social inquiry? According to interpretivists, it means that the key aim of social inquiry should be to enhance our _understanding_ of the social world’s meanings as opposed to producing causal explanations of social phenomena

#### Value neutrality 

Their (critical theory school) most important contribution to the critique of value neutrality lies in their exploration of the various ways that social science can serve to legitimate and reinforce oppressive values, beliefs and practices and thereby mask domination

to critical theorists, the goal of liberating people from societal shackles is the purpose for social inquiry

How, according to critical theorists, does naturalistic social science serve the status quo and mask domination? They argue that many of the supposedly neutral, objective concepts and categories of social science actually subtly but powerfully support particular political interests and worldviews.

### Expected Utility Theory
###### descriptive vs perscriptive and social models as self-fulfilling prophecies

### Performativity

At a minimum, however , what is made clear by the cases of Bolivia, Poland, Russia, and Chile, as well as by those discussed in the chapters that follow, is that economics is at work within economies in a way that is at odds with the widespread conception of science as an activity whose sole purpose is to observe and study, that is to "know" the world.

The issue that needs to be tackled in relation to economies and economics is not just about "knowing" the world, accurately or not. It is also about producing it. It is not (only) about economics being "right" or "wrong" but (also, and perhaps more important) about it being "able" or "unable" to transform the world.

Although (as far as we are aware) it was Austin who coined the term "performative," the notion partakes of a long pragmatist tradition (nourished by the work of authors such as Charles S. Peirce, W illiam James, John Dewey, Charles W. Morris, and more recently John R. Searle)1 for which a central issue is the way in which actions, entities, and representations are intertwined.

Although the origins of the notion of performativity lie in philosophy, the concept has been taken up in the social sciences and humanities more widely. Judith Butler, for example, has taken it into the mainstream of feminist theory (1990, 1997). The diverse fields that have adopted Robert K. Merton's (1949) notion of the "self-fulfilling prophecy"-in which the release and social circulation of a description or prediction enhances its validity--can be seen as investigating a version of performativity.
