### Mathematics
1. A model is true if it can be solved analytically (or something like that, if the solution is infinitely precise). **Example**: Kepler's equation
	1. Precise solutions exist for specific values. within the bounded scope, kepler's equation is both true and useful.
	2. While the model is also useful for other values, the solutions are only approximations, suggesting the inherent incompleteness of the model when modelling mathematical objects (it is not that there are not enough tools to find solutions, it is that the current extensions of the model are simply incomplete)
	2.1. Navier stokes equation make a single assumption on continuity and are known to be able describe turbulence properly. And yet the main drawback of this model is complexity of computation (due to nonlinearity) (I think I like this example more than weather modelling)
1. available methods and tools may expand the usefullness/scope of a model, but the lack of sufficient tools does not necessarily invalidate the model. (examples: chaotic systems?)


### Psychology
2. In psychology, models which are wrong are not useful
	1. contra: maslow pyramid criticisms
	2. pro: maslow pyramid use in developing conceptual understanding
3. Schelling's model of segregation
	“For example, the Schelling model of segregation treats a population and its residences as a lattice of squares, each of which can be populated or not by one of two types of individuals (Schelling 1969). The system evolves according to the rule that individuals move on a given turn if and only if they are surrounded by fewer individuals of the same type than some specified number. The stable states of such systems are highly segregated, and in them most individuals are surrounded by others of the same type. These models show that segregation can arise even when individuals have a relatively mild preference for being near others they perceive to be” “in some way similar to themselves”
4. Malthusian growth model was used to justify horrific colonial policy:   irish famine, etc. Simple models can be useful in developing conceptual understanding of complex systems and inspiring better, future research but abuse of such simple models may lead to destructive policy justification and choices which result in undesirable outcomes.
   
	 *John Maynard Keynes in the _General Theory_ gives generous credit to Malthus as his predecessor for having formulated a theory of "gluts," or what we would today call recessions*



### high level
1. Kepler's equation
	1. Kepler's equations only approximate, not solve (models are wrong because they approximate)
	2. Yet, relatively recently, exact, analytical solutions for certain objects have been found, suggesting that a model may be both true and useful when applied to specific objects (for certain objects,)
2. Navier-Stokes equations
	1. Kepler's equations are hypothesized to be best at explaining the chaotic nature of turbulence, yet even here a fundamental assumption on the continuum is made. This suggests that once mathematical models leave the perfect ream of mathematical reality and enter human reality, they become invalidated due to an essential assumption, but remain useful (as evident by the navier-stokes' equations' ability to explain turbulence)
	2. Yet the usefulness of navier-stokes' equations are limited by computational capacity, since the equations are known to be nonlinear. This suggests that usefulness and thus the validity of certain models in real-world applications may be limited and a skewed perception of the models truth may be developed due to limited methods/tools
3. Schelling's model of segregation & Malthusian growth model
	1. Such simple models such as Schelling's and Malthus' may inspire future, direct research and theory development. Suggesting that initially simple models play a fundamental role in the development of better, accurate models. Thus such simple models gain usefulness/utility by inspiring future research
	2. Yet such simple models may be used to justify abhorrent policy decisions (british colonialism) or potentially ignore other fundamental components of segregation (schelling). This suggests that inappropriate use of simple models may lead to undesirable outcomes, thus obviously diminishing the utility that is derived from the use of such models. This indicates the delicate role that models must play in the human sciences
4. Classical conditioning
	1. Classical conditioning provides a simple model that helps develop a conceptual understanding of the complex learning process
	2. Due to behavioral engineerging, applications may find an inflated success rate (lab conditions vs real-world conditions), suggesting that not only the object of interest or context, but also the environment in which a model is applied determine the model's accuracy and validity


### High level human sciences v2

1. malthusian model has lead to devastating policy (value neutrality disguised with ideology)
2. Malthus' work inspired keynes
3. Classical conditioning has proved to a be a true observation
4. Yet, if the goal of social sciences is interpretive, is classical conditioning really useful? for it is a mere description of phenomena, which allows us to appreciate learning processes, but it serves as neither a tool for prediction nor a medium for interpretation


### Navier Stokes equations

fundamental assumption of continuuity disagrees with real world facts (that all fluids are made of a very large, but discrete number of particles). this is why the model is wrong

sometimes the usefulness of a mathematical model is limited not by its assumptions but rather by the available computational resources


### Kepler's equation

objects that travel in ellyptical orbits sweep out equal areas in equal times. kepler's equation connects time to an object's position in orbit.

langrage inversion (analytical method) vs newton-rhapson (numerical) shows that a models utility is determined not only by the properties of the model but also by the methods applied on the model. 


### useful?

- the philosophical idea of "useful fiction"
- scientific instrumentalism vs scientific realism (maybe in the conclusions)
- analytical vs numerical mathematical methods
- plato's pure mathematics
