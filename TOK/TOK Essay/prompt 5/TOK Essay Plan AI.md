Introduction:

- Present Box's claim and its implications for knowledge creation
- Introduce mathematics and human sciences as areas of exploration

Mathematics Section:

1. Kepler's Equations
    - Counter-argument: Recent exact solutions suggest models can be both true and useful
    - Supporting argument: Most applications still rely on approximations, supporting Box's claim
2. Navier-Stokes Equations
    - Supporting argument: Continuum assumption shows inherent model limitations
    - Counter-argument: Computational limitations affect perceived model validity rather than actual validity

Human Sciences Section:

1. Schelling and Malthus Models
    - Supporting argument: Simple models' role in theory development
    - Counter-argument: Potential misuse leading to harmful applications
2. Classical Conditioning
    - Supporting argument: Initial simplification of complex learning processes
    - Counter-argument: Self-fulfilling prophecy aspect challenges the "all models are wrong" premise

Conclusion:

- Synthesize how different types of models in both fields support and challenge Box's claim
- Reflect on the implications for knowledge creation and application
