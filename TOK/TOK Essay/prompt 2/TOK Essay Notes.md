#### idea for art

**fragile:** are the classes we assign art really based in some objective truth? (Cambridge pg. 441 and above). What is real art and what is kitsch? the definition and classifications of art are more often disputes about our values and where we are trying to go with our society, rather than being about any theory of art. No wonder that surrealism challenged art.

**rigid:** Correct ways in provoking an emotional reaction? throughout centuries, despite various "revolutions", the standard realistic depiction of the world around us has maintained prevalence. perhaps there is an objective way in invoking a reaction using tried techniques (some example in art) and the rule of two-thirds in photography. Old techniques are not invalidated due to prevalence of "modern art". it is just that modern art offers a different, maybe more intellectual and provocative perspective? Does such art stand **the test of time**?

classification and technique are not mutually exclusive? just because traditional realism is no longer the primadona of art, it does not mean that there is no value to be derived from such art

#### idea for human sciences

**fragile**: The validity of Jungian Psychology/Jungian Archetypes, it seems, due to it's non-empirical nature, is also subject to the changing sentiments and values of the environment it exists. when the field of psychoanalysis was young, Jung's ideas were highly respected, but as psychology transitioned into a field governed by empirical experiments, Jung has been delegated to a historical footnote. This highlights how the validity of ideas in the human sciences are subject entirely to the society/environment that observes those ideas

**rigid**: we could thus deem that the field of psychology as a whole is a hoax, yet modern psychological applications like perscripition drugs to treat depression have seen real-world success, suggesting that the fragility of knowledge is dependent on it's applicability in the real world
