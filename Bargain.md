### Commentary 1, Criterion E

> Judgments are made that are supported by limited reasoning. ==It is not clear why the author analyses effects of Pigouvian tax, if he at once admits it to be ineffective remedy==. Limitations of subsidies are not conidered. Besides, ==it is not clear what type of subsidies the author recommends==.

Regarding the tax, I tried to somehow relay that a policy which only utilized the tax would face backlash ("*Inequality alongside increased burden on the consumer and fluctuating elasticity of demand renders the pigouvian tax a lacklustre short-term solution.*")

My argument was that the tax in tandem with a subsidy would be a holistic approach. The tax alone might be too regressive while a subsidy might be too politically unfavourable ("*While many countries (like the US) are expected to enforce a stricter monetary policy and limit government spending \[...]*")

Finally, the conclusion was: "*Instead, a pigouvian tax could be supplemented by subsidies which promote sustainable aviation practices*". 

Also, I mentioned in the commentary that "*a per-unit subsidy (tax breaks or similar incentives) could be provided to airlines which increasingly adopt sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and operate modern aircraft.*"

Suprantu, kad mano argumentai labai pritempti, bet I hope, kad cia bent kazkiek pades geriau gauti is E

### Commentary 2, Criterion A

> Diagrams are relevant. However there are more than few inaccuracies: unconventional labels (in IB context), deflationary gap in figure 1 is not the case with cost-push inflation; ==besides figure 1 could have been  better explained==

The deflationary gap was an incredible mistake on my part, but as I understand 1 point is given for diagrams that have not been explained (some weird guide: https://www.aisegypt.com/uploaded/2015_Redesign/Academics/International_Baccalaureate/Summer_Assignments/IB_-_Summer_2017/IB_Summer_Assignment_-_corrections/Economics_-_IA_Rubric.pdf)

Point 2 is given for diagrams which are not fully explained, of course, it's in my greatest interest to argue for more points, I hope that the use of empirical evidence ("*Studies approximate that anomalously hot years are responsible for 0.3-1% of GDP loss in the EU \[6], illustrated by the decrease in GDP from Q1 to Q2.*") might make up for the deflationary gap mistake

If not, that is understandable

### Commentary 3, Criterion A
> The diagrams are relevant, well labelled and explained, but the second diagram ==incorrectly depicts the intervention of BoJ as an increased supply rather than demad of yen==.

Cia jau labai pritempineju, bet gal man iseitu argumentuoti, kad minejau, jog BOJ siekia ilgam laikui islaikyti currency stability (*"However, intervention faces significant practical limitations due to the difficulty of sustaining long-term currency stabilization in highly liquid global markets where daily trading volumes exceed 7.51 trillion(US$)*)

Radau tokia istrauka is straipsnio: "*However, contractionary measures by the BOJ, aimed at reducing the supply of JPY, can have the opposite effect by strengthening the JPY*" (https://blueberrymarkets.com/market-analysis/the-impact-of-boj-on-the-forex-market/)
