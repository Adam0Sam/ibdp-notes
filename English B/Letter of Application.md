The contents of the letter itself should be comprised not of achievements but rather skills/values you earned while performing certain activities.

Prioritize qualities which are regarded in a positive manner and which can be proven/talked about easier

Finally, the last paragraphs should express any indirect inquires/questions (preferably one) alongside 
gratitude.
