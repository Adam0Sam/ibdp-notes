#### Context
Something of import to the author, be it a dilemma or emotional stress. 

#### Audience
In the case of the diary, the author is also the intended audience. Journals, however, may be also intended for the public

#### Purpose
Describe and reflect. Narrating is least important, there is no reason for explanation (for example, explaining who your mom is). The focus is set on the emotion and its mutation.

#### Register
Generally informal. There can be exceptions, for example, in the case that one is attempting to appear arrogant. 

#### Tone
personal, frank and open - e.g. emotions may be described clearly and with feeling. Chatty style, phrasal verbs (with '*get*' and so on), idioms, colloquial language. 

#### Convention
- The beginning definitely includes some sort of date, day or another expression for the current time. Also a reference (like '*dear diary*')
* will use first person narration
* will avoid self-evident explanatory phrases or sentences, e.g. will use “I saw Alicia”, not “I saw Alicia, my best friend”
* will have a closing statement to round off the entry (like '*Okay, never mind, it will be fine*'). A sendoff ('*goodbye*') is also recommended
An introduction, body and conclusion, even though this is a very personal text, are present (ofc, you have more freedom with paragraph length, count, etc) (*the teacher recommends still maintaining short paragraphs as its more difficult to fully develop an idea an not digress in a longer paragraph*)
