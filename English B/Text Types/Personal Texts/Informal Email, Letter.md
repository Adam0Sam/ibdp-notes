  #### Context
The question will usually describe a background situation, which the writes wishes to communicate to smb. There is a need for communication, whether it stems from a previously lackluster relationship or a situation that demands attention. Matters must be of a personal nature. 

#### Audience
A specified friend/acquaintance. The audience really doesn't get more specific/defined than this

#### Purpose
To express and explore personal attitudes and experience: usually of the writer, but perhaps involving advice to the reader. The need to communicate, ask questions and interact with the reader in general must be expressed. 

#### Register
Consistently informal to neutral (depending on the degree of raport)

#### Tone
Lively, engaging. Slang is appreciated. Shorter sentences, contractions, exaggerated exclamations. Colloquial expressions, phrasal verbs, abbreviations and the like. Overall attempt to relate shared personal experiences

#### Conventions
- Clear sense of address to a specific person is maintained
- An appropriate opening salutation, a subject line in the beginning (e.g. "*Subject: Re: Hello from Thailand!*"). Important to have very informative and breif Subject lines, optimally include a date and event/reason for writing or smth
- An appropriate closing salutation (note that the punctuation in both salutations ought to be consistent)

> [!Example] Appropriate?
> An **(informal) email / letter**  will be appropriate if the task requires you to communicate some personal experiences, thoughts and feelings to somebody you know. This sort of writing is public only in the sense that you are having a conversation limited to a friend - it is a private form of sharing.

_Not to be confused with..._

... **_'_**_**blog'**_ or **_'social media posting / online forum_'** ...  a _'blog'_ is essentially a very public sort of online statement - you intend to present some of your personal ideas in a lively entertaining way to a general, undefined audience. You want to entertain, and hook your (unknown) audience by your interesting, even provocative, opinions and experiences. A _'social media posting in an online forum'_ may well express your personal thoughts and feelings, but it is also a public statement, and it will probably be mainly in response to other statements that have been made in the forum - it can be seen as a conversation, but it is a conversation with people you don't know intimately.
