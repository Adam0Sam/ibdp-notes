#### Context
Generally, a problem is present to which the text is going to propose a solution

#### Audience
The range of specification in this regard is quite broad, depends on the context

#### Purpose
The basic purpose of these text types is publicity, to market and sell the proposed solution

#### Register and Tone
Register ranges from *semi-formal* to *formal*
The tone tends to be simple and direct, in the hope to convey a sense of honesty 

#### Conventions
- Engaging Title (*to attract attention*)
- Formatting techniques (*sub-headings, bullet-points, numbering, etc*)
- A mission statement is suggested in the beginning
- Unlike most [[Mass Media Texts]], these texts will have a short introduction and a conclusion
- The end of the text contains a *call-to-action* phrase, contact info and various testimonies

### Differences between the three
- Brochures are mainly used to *sell* items, ideas
- Leaflets are usually tools of invitation
- Pamphlets are used to relay information and persuade the audience (with the goal not necessarily being to sell smth)

> [!Example] Appropriate?
> A **brochure / leaflet** will be appropriate if the task requires you to present information widely, in a clear and direct way. The audience will usually be the public in general, although the text may be targeted at specific sections of the general public (e.g. young people, people who live in a particular place, etc). The point is that a brochure/ leaflet can be 'broadcast' - it can be given out freely to anybody, and you don't need contact addresses.Â

_Not to be confused with..._

... **_'[[Speeches|speech, presentation]]'_** _or **'[[Proposals|proposal]]'** or '**set of instructions or guidelines**'_ ... a _'speech'_ or a _'presentation'_ is oral, and requires people in a special place at a special time - so how do you get all of your target audience there? In addition, you can refer to a brochure/leaflet, but you can't keep an oral presentation. A brochure/leaflet is often used to propose ideas (e.g. political leaflets), but a _'proposal'_ is usually a formal document presenting facts and figures for serious discussion, and is not really a form of publicity, selling something (persuading, yes, but that's different). A _'set of instructions or guidelines'_ is intended to be practical - the text type(s) is intended to show people what they ought to do, in clearly explained situations: it is intended to help, not to sell or to convince.
