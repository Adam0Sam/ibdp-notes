> [!Warning] Note: 
> These two text types are significantly different in that an Opinion column is presumed to be written by a *professional* journalist, while a Letter to the Editor is presumed to be written by a *non-professional* member of the public - but what they both have in common is that they should concentrate on expressing a clear point of view, as forcefully and interestingly as possible.

#### Context
A general situation, which results in some kind of issue, on which the writer chooses to take a particular stance or judgement. This can include responses to other articles, pictures, events, etc. 
The Opinion column is most often *printed* in a newspaper. (The text is very closely related to the [[Editorial]])

#### Audience 
Can be assumed to be reasonably informed about the issue in question, and to have the developed intelligence and the language skills to be able to handle quite complex arguments

#### Purpose
To discuss in a provocative and stimulating way and to explore the issue in some depth

#### Register
*Semi-formal to formal*

#### Tone
Appropriate to the topic and approach: suitably serious or possible provocative and amusing

#### Conventions
- Relevant headline/title, as is common in all [[Mass Media Texts]]
- Introduction to catch the readers' attention
- Techniques to engage and interest readers (*e.g. direct address*)
- *might* be in first-person

> [!Example] Appropriate?
> An **opinion column** will be appropriate if the task requires you to focus on one particular issue, which should be explained convincingly and your final opinion argued reasonably. Since an opinion column will have been commissioned by a particular media organisation, it should be written to suitÂ the audience of the publication in which it appears.

_Not to be confused with..._

... '**_[[Blogs|blog]]_'** or _**'[[Essays|essay]]'**_ ... a 'blog' is intended to present a set of your personal ideas in a lively entertaining way to a general, undefined audience - who you want to hook with your interesting, even provocative, opinions and experiences. An 'essay' is supposed to be a methodical and objective review of arguments, based on solid factual evidence, and reaching a logical conclusion suitable for thoughtful, educated people (not just a personal opinion).
