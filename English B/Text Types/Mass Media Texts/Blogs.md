Blogs are exclusive in the context of audience. They have a specific intended audience??

Context: You have shared interests, shared need or experience
The level of formality, as is common in mass media texts, varies dramatically.
Purpose of the blog
1. Know-how: Explain by presenting steps
2. Opinion: Explain/Persuade by presenting arguments 
Blogs are subjective and direct (as if you were to talking to the reader)
Text conventions:
1. Know-how: sub-headings, bullet-points, no summary, *in the final paragraph* relate to the first paragraph (call to action or the like), a final phrase should request comments and reviews, leave contact information
2. Opinion blogs: sub-headings and bullet points are not necessary, relate to your personal experience, give personal examples, its okay to employ a first person pov, conclusion is the same as in the *know-how blog*.

> [!Warning] Two types of blogs
> 1. Know-How: communication via the presentation of steps (in the hope of explaining)
> 2. Opinion: communication via the presentation of arguments (in the hope of persuading/explaining)
#### Context
An issue, which inspires your blog, will usually be set out in the question

#### Audience
The audience may be assumed to be people interested in the subject matter *OR* young, tech/internet literate and interested individuals. In general, the audience is pretty loosely defined

#### Purpose
Depends of which **type** of blog the author is concerned with. Generally, the goal is to explain/persuade with the additional criteria of raising interest/entertaining/amusing/being provocative & stimulating

#### Register
Semi-formal to informal

#### Tone
Personal, chatty, direct and unpretentious

#### Conventions
- Oft includes a first person address, whether its a statement and/or narration
- Engaging the reader through direct adresses, lively/interesting style

> [!Example] Appropriate? 
> A **blog** will be appropriate if the task requires you to present a set of your personal ideas in a lively entertaining way to a general, undefined audience. You don't know who might find your blog on the internet, but you want them to be hooked by your interesting, even provocative, opinions and experiences.

_Not to be confused with..._
>
_**'[[Articles|article]]'**_ or '**_[[Opinion Columns, Letters to the Editor|opinion column]]_'** or _**'[[Essays|essay]]'**_ ... an '_article'_ is intended to present detailed and interesting information about a defined subject to a general audience; and the information should be explained in a clear, fair and reasonably objective way (the journalist has a 'duty to inform').Â An _'opinion column'_ will usually be focused on one particular issue, which should be explained convincingly and your final opinion argued reasonably, even if it is a very subjective point of view. An _'essay_' is supposed to be a methodical and objective review of arguments, based on solid factual evidence, and reaching a logical conclusion (which is not the same as just a quick opinion).
>
In addition, both _'opinion column'_ and _'essay'_ are likely to have more defined audiences - _'opinion column'_ = the audience of the publication in which it appears; _'essay'_ = thoughtful, educated people, rather than just anybody.
