#### Context
Usually the type *and behavior* of the audience is specified (whether the audience expects to be informed, challenged, etc).
#### Audience
Of course, the audience is a group of people who have gathered to listen to you. They can generally be assumed to be reasonably educated and informed, and capable of understanding sophisticated language (*unless some particular audience is specified in the task*)
#### Purpose
some mixture of 'inform' and 'persuade' (with perhaps a good dash of 'amuse & entertain' for rhetorical purposes)
#### Register
informal to semi-formal
#### Tone
Appropriately (in regards to the topic) serious
#### Conventions
- *In the beginning*, thank the audience, relay your humility and attempt to catch their attention
- Address the audience and maintain contact throughout the speech (*direct approach*)
- Rhetorical devices 
- Thematically relate the past, present and future
- *In the end*, restate your thesis, present a call to action, once again thank the audience,

> [!Example] Appropriate?
> A **Speech / Presentation** will be appropriate if the task requires you to present your ideas personally, on a public occasion. The task will usually make clear the context and the audience (for example, talking about a major change in your school, to an audience of fellow students). It will be appropriate to make a speech if you are required to interest, or motivate, or inspire your audience, by using vivid rhetoric and direct interaction with the audience.

... **_'[[Opinion Columns, Letters to the Editor|opinion column]]'_** _or **'[[Proposals|proposal]]'**_ or **_'[[Brochures, Leaflets, Pamphlets|brochure / leaflet]]'_** ... an _'opinion column_' is usually focused on one particular issue, which is explained convincingly and the final opinion argued reasonably - and because an opinion column is read, it is more appropriate for quiet reflection, rather than the dramatic persuasion expected in a speech. A _'proposal'_ is intended to present some kind of project formally, based on facts and figures, for serious discussion with a particular audience. A _'brochure / leaflet'_ may be used to present your ideas, but rather if you want the ideas to reach a wider group of people than could attend a speech
