#### Context
The basic background information will be presented, likely an issue which ought to be formally addressed with a new policy, practice, etc..

#### Audience
Specified persons or group will be identified in the question.

#### Purpose
To solve a presented issue/problem. From this it follows that the proposal ought to be *relevant*, *practical*, *attractive* (so as to sell the idea)

#### Register
A very formal register. Some semi-formal elements may be allowed

#### Tone
Objectively authoritative and at the same time subjectively enthusiastic

#### Conventions
- Style is used purposely for persuasion
- *In the beginning*, a title which summarises the overall subject and a formal introduction
- Headings, short and clear paragraphs, sections identified by *letter/numbers/bullets*
- *In the end*, a formal conclusion

> [!Example] Appropriate?
> A **proposal** will be appropriate if the task requires you to present some kind of project formally, based on facts and figures, for serious discussion. The audience will usually be quite specific i.e. those who will take a decision about your idea - and so you need to present ideas in clear and logically convincing ways (without obvious publicity or advertising bullshit !)

... **_'[[Brochures, Leaflets, Pamphlets|brochure, leaflet]]'_** orÂ  _'**set of instructions or guidelines**'_ or **_'[[Speeches|speech, presentation]]_'** ... a _'brochure/leaflet'_ is often used to propose ideas (e.g. political leaflets), but is best used to present information to a wide and general audience, not a very specific audience of decision-makers. A _'set of instructions or guidelines'_ is intended to be practical - the text type(s) is intended to show people what they ought to do, in clearly explained situations: it is intended to help, not to sell or to convince. A _'speech'_ or a _'presentation_' is oral, and so may be most appropriate if you are required to sell your proposal through exciting rhetoric - but if the purpose is to convince people seriously, they need to be able to be able to refer to your ideas, consider them slowly, and so a formal written proposal would be better.
