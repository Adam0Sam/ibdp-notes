In choosing an appropriate text type, one must consider the following:
- *Context* - what sort of real-life situation does the task refer to?
- *Audience* - who exactly is supposed to read and receive this text?
- *Purpose* - what should the text communicate, with what sort of approach?

> [!Tip] Differentiation based on two factors
> 1. Is the audience *specific (clearly defined and limited)*  or *non-specific (general and undefined)*  
> 2. Is the writing *private (personal and not for the general knowledge)* or *public (a statement to the world at large)*
>

Texts can be broadly categorized into three main groups: **[[Mass Media Texts]]**, **[[Professional Texts]]** and **[[Personal Texts]]**



> [!Warning] Topic Sentences
> Though it may seem formal, every good text, regardless of its type, has a topic sentence
