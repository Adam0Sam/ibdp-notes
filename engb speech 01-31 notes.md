2. O'Brien - not just a villain, but a philosophical framework that challenges our fundamental understanding of political power.
3. the Party's true innovation lies not in its methods of control, but in its transformation of power from a means to an end in itself
4. Machiavelli - power maintain order, Marx - tool for social transformation, O'Brien - self-contained system, divorced from any external purpose, in parallel to Nietzche's 'will to power' but perverted fundamentally
5. paradoxical relationship with history - the past is mutable, as current Party records dictate. '*Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past,*'

7. history is both meaningless and instructive: not just truth, but the framework
