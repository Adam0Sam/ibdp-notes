A compound proposition is said to a be a tautology if and only if it is true for all possible combinations of truth variables which it contains

$$
P \text{ is a tautology} \leftrightarrow  P\equiv \mathbb{T}
$$

> [!example] 
> The fact that the proposition $((p \lor q) \to \lnot q) \to p$ is a tautology can be checked with a truth table

> [!tip] Relation to [[Contradiction|contradictions]]
>$$
P \ \text{ is a tautology} \equiv \lnot P \ \text{ is a contradiction}
>$$
> the converse is also true
