A one-place predicate associates a proposition with each entity in the domain of discourse for the predicate.

If $P$ is a predicate and $a$ is an entity in the domain of discourse for $P$, then $P(a)$ denotes the that is associated with $a$ by $P$. (*We say that $P(a)$ is the result of applying $P$ to $a$*)
