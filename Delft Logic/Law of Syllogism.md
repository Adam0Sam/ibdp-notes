Though it is a misuse of terminology, syllogism can be understood as some law of the associativity of [[implications]], i.e.

$$
\begin{align}
&\text{If } \mathcal{P}\implies \mathcal{L} \ \text{ and } \ \mathcal{L} \implies \mathcal{R} \ \text{ are both true}. \\
& \text{then it follows that } \ \mathcal{P}\implies \mathcal{R} \ \text{ is true}.
\end{align}
$$
