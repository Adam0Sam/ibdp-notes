A logic circuit (*a collection of connected logic gates*) that does not contain a feedback loop is called a **combinatorial circuit**.

Every combinatorial circuit with just one output computes the value of some [[Proposition classifications|compound proposition]]. The propositional variables in the compound proposition are just names associated with the input wires of the circuit.

The converse is also true, every proposition may be expressed as a combinatorial logic circuit. 

> [!info] Therefore..
 Compound propositions correspond naturally with combinatorial logic circuits


> [!tip] Logical equivalence in terms of circuits
> Propositions that are logically equivalent produce circuits that have the same input/output behaviour
