> [!info] What is a proposition?
A proposition is a *statement* which is either tru or false

It is useful to classify propositions into [[Proposition classifications|certain types]]

> [!info] Logical operators and compound propositions
> Logical operators (*or connectives*) combine propositions to form new *compound* propositions. The most fundamental of these are: $\lnot$, $\land$, $\lor$ (*listed in order of precedence*). [[More logical operators]], of course, exist
> 
> Every compound proposition has a main connective, a "sub-proposition" that is evaluated last, according to precedence rules and parantheses

### Functionally complete operators

A set of logical operators is functionally complete if and only if all formulas in propositional logic can be rewritten to an equivalent form that uses only operators from the set.
 
A functionally complete operator set could be made up of ($\land$ and $\lnot$) or ($\lor$ and $\lnot$) or all three

Effectively, all propositions may be transformed to their [[Normal Form]]


> [!info] Logical Equivalence
> Two compound propositions are logically equivalent if they have the same truth values for all possible truth values of the propositional variables they contain
