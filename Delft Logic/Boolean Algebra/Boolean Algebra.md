In boolean algebra, only two logical values are used: $\mathbb{T}$ (1) and $\mathbb{F}$ (0)

There are a few [[Basic of Boolean Algebra|fundamental laws]] which are can easily be shown to hold via the use of truth tables

[[Substitution Laws|Substitution laws]] hold that any compound proposition, no matter how complicated, has a particular truth value. Because of this, the [[Basic of Boolean Algebra|fundamental laws]] may derive lots of applications
