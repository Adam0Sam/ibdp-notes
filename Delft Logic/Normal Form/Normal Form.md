Given any compound proposition (or a corresponding truth table), it is possible to find a (*normal*) proposition  containing only $\lnot$, $\land$, $\lor$ operators (which form a [[Propositional Logic#Functionally complete operators|functionally complete operator set]])

Two such forms exist
1. [[Disjunctive Normal Form]]
2. Conjuctive Normal Form
