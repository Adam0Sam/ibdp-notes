The proposition $p \to q$ is called an *implication* (*or conditional*). In such a proposition, $p$ is called the *hypothesis* (*or antecedent*) and $q$ is called the *conclusion* (*or consequent*)

> [!tip] Sufficiency and necessity
Furthermore we say that if the implication $p→q$ holds, then $p$ is sufficient for $q$ (i.e. if $p$ is true, then we can say that $q$ is true). 
>
Conversely, we say that $q$ is necessary for $p$ (i.e. if $q$ is not true, then it is impossible for $p$ to be true)

> [!info] The contrapositive
> The implication $\lnot q \to \lnot p$ is called the contrapositive of $p \to q$. All implications are logically equivalent to their contrapositives. From this it is possible to perform "[[proof by contrapositive|proofs by contrapositive]]"

> [!info] The converse
> The implication $q \to p$ is called the converse of $p \to q$. Implications are, clearly, not logically equivalent to their converses, though it is possible for both to be true at the same time

> [!info] The inverse
> Similarly, $p \to q$ is not logically equivalent to $\lnot p \to \lnot q$, as $\lnot p \to \lnot q$ is the inverse of $p \to q$

> [!tip] Logical equivalence in terms of [[Propositional Logic|universal logical operators]]
> $p \to q \equiv \lnot q \lor p$
