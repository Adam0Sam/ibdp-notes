Besides $\lnot$, $\land$, and $\lor$, very commonly used operators include
- The *[[Implications|conditional]]* operator, $\rightarrow$ 
- The *[[The biconditional operator|biconditional]]* operator, $\leftrightarrow$
- The *[[The exclusive or operator|exclusive or]]* operator, $\oplus$

> [!tip] Precedence
When these operators are used in [[Propositional Logic|compound expression]], the $\oplus$ has the same precedence as $\lor$, the $\rightarrow$ has lower precedence than $\lor$, and $\leftrightarrow$ has the lowest precedence

Any compound proposition that use the aforementioned operators can be expressed using the [[Propositional Logic|foundational operators]].
