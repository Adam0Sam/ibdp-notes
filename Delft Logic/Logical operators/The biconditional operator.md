The biconditional operator is closely related to the [[Implications|conditional]] operator. In fact, it is logically equivalent to the conjuction of an implication and its converse 
$$
p\leftrightarrow q \equiv (p\to q) \land(q\to p)
$$


> [!tip] Defining logical equivalence via the biconditional operator
> Two compound propositions, $P$ and $Q$, are said to be logically equivalent if and only if the proposition $P \leftrightarrow Q$ is a [[tautology]]
